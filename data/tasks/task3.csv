# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Labor demand shifts
Outcome: Wage structure changes
Context: This paper studies U.S. labor-market changes from the 1970s through 2004—highlighting 1979–1987 and 1988–2004—using individual hourly wages from CPS (MORG/May), occupational employment shares from 1980/1990/2000 IPUMS, and task-based job data (Dictionary of Occupational Titles), with supplementary IRS and ECI evidence. Units are workers and occupations across the United States. The analysis situates observed wage and employment polarization in a setting of falling computer prices, rising computerization and outsourcing, and changing institutions (minimum wage and unions) that altered labor demand by task.

# Target Context
Using 1979 and 1987 Current Population Survey data for U.S. nonagricultural employees aged 18–64, the paper analyzes group-level (education × experience × sex) changes in log hourly wages across 17 industries to explain large 1979–87 shifts: rising returns to schooling, greater experience differentials among lower-educated workers, and a narrower gender gap. The authors combine cross-sectional wage regressions, industry employment-change measures, and Oaxaca-style decompositions to evaluate explanations tied to product-demand/trade shocks, within-industry rent changes, technological bias, and changes in unobserved labor quality.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Past cigarette price
Outcome: Current cigarette consumption
Context: This paper analyzes annual state-level per-capita cigarette sales across U.S. states (50 states + DC) over 1955–1985, exploiting cross-state and over-time variation in retail prices and state excise taxes, along with smuggling and demographic controls. The unit is state-year aggregate cigarette packs sold; the institutional setting includes large heterogeneity in state cigarette taxes and industry pricing (including 1982–83 industry price increases and federal tax changes). The study uses panel methods and instruments to estimate short- and long-run price elasticities and intertemporal addiction dynamics.

## Example 2
Treatment: Cigarette price
Outcome: Youth smoking participation
Context: This estimate pertains to U.S. teen smoking during 1991–1997 across states, using Monitoring the Future, YRBS, and Vital Statistics Natality data and exploiting within‑state over‑time variation in cigarette prices (prices instrumented with state excise taxes), with state and year fixed effects. The negative effect on smoking participation is concentrated among older teens (high‑school seniors); price effects are insignificant for younger teens.

You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Past cigarette consumption
Outcome: Current cigarette consumption
Context: This paper analyzes individual-level cigarette demand in the United States using NHANES II survey data collected 1976–1980 (adults up to age 74). It exploits cross-state and local variation in cigarette prices and excise taxes (including nearest-border prices) together with respondents' recalled past, current, and peak smoking to estimate dynamic demand and an addictive stock. The institutional setting highlights tax-driven price variation and health-policy relevance for current, former, and ever smokers.
Sign: -


# Target Context
This paper analyzes annual state-level per-capita cigarette sales across U.S. states (50 states + DC) over 1955–1985, exploiting cross-state and over-time variation in retail prices and state excise taxes, along with smuggling and demographic controls. The unit is state-year aggregate cigarette packs sold; the institutional setting includes large heterogeneity in state cigarette taxes and industry pricing (including 1982–83 industry price increases and federal tax changes). The study uses panel methods and instruments to estimate short- and long-run price elasticities and intertemporal addiction dynamics.

Outcome: Cognitive test scores
Context: The analysis uses within-family (sibling) comparisons: children are compared to their siblings using family fixed effects and difference-in-differences to estimate the impact of Head Start on cognitive test scores (notably PPVT and Piat-Math, and Piat-Reading). Estimates compare Head Start participants to siblings who stayed at home or attended other preschools, with outcomes including test scores and grade repetition.

# Target Context
This paper uses the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child–Mother data (children of the 1979 NLSY cohort, surveyed in 1986–1990) to estimate effects of participation in the federal Head Start preschool program on children’s cognitive scores, grade repetition, immunizations, and height, and on longer‑run outcomes for women. Units are children (and mothers with sister comparisons); the sample is national with oversamples of African‑Americans and Hispanics. Identification relies on within‑family comparisons to address time‑invariant family confounders.

Context: This empirical study analyzes annual state-level data for U.S. states over 1979–1992 (mainly 1980–1992, with robustness to 1983–1992). The unit is state-year (≈45 states); outcomes are infant mortality rates and Medicaid physician, clinic, and hospital expenditures per woman aged 15–44. It leverages cross-state, over-time variation in Medicaid ob/gyn fee-to-private-fee ratios and expansions of Medicaid pregnancy eligibility, using Vital Statistics and HCFA payment data and state and year fixed effects.

# Target Context
This paper studies US Medicaid eligibility expansions for pregnant women across 49 states (plus DC) during 1979–1990. Units include state-year aggregates (Vital Statistics infant outcomes) and individual women aged 15–44 (CPS, NLSY). It exploits cross-state, over-time variation from targeted AFDC-linked expansions in the early 1980s and broader income-based expansions (1987–1990, e.g. 133%–185% FPL) to assess effects on low birthweight, infant mortality, Medicaid take-up, service use, and program expenditures.

This empirical study analyzes annual state-level data for U.S. states over 1979–1992 (mainly 1980–1992, with robustness to 1983–1992). The unit is state-year (≈45 states); outcomes are infant mortality rates and Medicaid physician, clinic, and hospital expenditures per woman aged 15–44. It leverages cross-state, over-time variation in Medicaid ob/gyn fee-to-private-fee ratios and expansions of Medicaid pregnancy eligibility, using Vital Statistics and HCFA payment data and state and year fixed effects.

- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Common law legal origin
Outcome: Shareholder rights
Context: This paper analyzes cross-country variation in investor protection and financial development using 49 countries (excluding recent socialist states) in the late 20th century. Rights measures are centered on laws circa 1993, enforcement indices are averaged through the 1980s–1995, and financial/openness measures use 1985–1995 averages. The unit of observation is the country; regressions examine how culture proxies (primary religion and language), legal origin (common vs. civil law), income per capita, and measures of trade openness relate to shareholder and creditor rights and their enforcement.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This empirical study (early–mid 1990s) assembles legal-rule and enforcement data as of 1993–94 (accounting measures from 1991) for 49 countries worldwide (Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia) that had ≥5 domestic non‑financial publicly traded firms in 1993. The units are country-level legal provisions (company and bankruptcy law), enforcement and accounting-quality indices, and aggregated ownership stakes of large listed firms. The analysis exploits cross-country variation in legal origin (common law vs. French/German/Scandinavian civil law) to explain investor protections and ownership concentration.

## Example 1
Treatment: Reduction in standard hours
Outcome: Straight-time hourly wage
Context: This paper studies the causal effect of reductions in collectively-bargained standard weekly hours in (West) Germany, primarily 1984–1989 with additional analysis for 1990–1994, exploiting monthly industry‑level panel data on 201 manufacturing industries and individual-level German Socio‑Economic Panel data on full‑time workers. The institutional setting is industry-level union bargaining (notably IG Metall) that implemented stepwise cuts in standard hours, overtime premia, and greater hours flexibility; outcomes examined include employment, hours per worker, worker‑hours, and wage bills.
Sign: None

## Example 2
Treatment: Reduction in standard hours

## Example 1
Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Using U.S. publicly listed firm-year data (main 1993–2019; extended OLS sample 1965–2019), the paper studies how firm-level uncertainty shocks—measured by realized and option-implied stock-return volatility—affect investment, employment, sales and firms’ financial policies. Identification exploits industry-level exposures to oil, seven major currencies, and economic policy uncertainty as instruments.

## Example 2
Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.

The paper exploits within-job temporal variation from industry-level union‑negotiated reductions in standard weekly hours (mid‑1980s onward) and estimates person–job fixed-effects panel regressions (with IV robustness) to relate reductions in agreed standard hours to changes in actual weekly hours.

## Example 2
Treatment: Reduction in standard hours
Outcome: Straight-time hourly wage
Context: Using German Socio-Economic Panel data 1984–1989, this paper studies individual workers (person-job spells) in West Germany—particularly Arbeiter (hourly) and Angestellten (salaried) in manufacturing, construction and services—during union-negotiated stepwise reductions in industry-level standard weekly hours (starting in 1985, notably metalworking/printing). The institutional setting features collective bargaining, overtime premiums, flexibility clauses, and industry-level wage negotiations; the paper exploits within-job temporal variation across industries to estimate effects of standard-hours reductions on actual hours and straight-time hourly wages.

# Target Context
This paper studies the causal effect of reductions in collectively-bargained standard weekly hours in (West) Germany, primarily 1984–1989 with additional analysis for 1990–1994, exploiting monthly industry‑level panel data on 201 manufacturing industries and individual-level German Socio‑Economic Panel data on full‑time workers. The institutional setting is industry-level union bargaining (notably IG Metall) that implemented stepwise cuts in standard hours, overtime premia, and greater hours flexibility; outcomes examined include employment, hours per worker, worker‑hours, and wage bills.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Head Start participation
Outcome: Test scores
Context: This paper uses the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child–Mother data (children of the 1979 NLSY cohort, surveyed in 1986–1990) to estimate effects of participation in the federal Head Start preschool program on children’s cognitive scores, grade repetition, immunizations, and height, and on longer‑run outcomes for women. Units are children (and mothers with sister comparisons); the sample is national with oversamples of African‑Americans and Hispanics. Identification relies on within‑family comparisons to address time‑invariant family confounders.

Using industry- and plant-level data (UN industrial statistics, U.S. Census/ASM, Worker–Establishment matches), the authors analyze within-industry and cross-country shifts in skilled (nonproduction) versus unskilled (production) workers, relating pervasive microprocessor-driven, skill‑biased technological change to changes in relative wages, employment composition, trade exposure, and national labor-market institutions.

## Example 2
Treatment: Skill-biased technological change
Outcome: Proportion of skilled workers
Context: This triplet refers specifically to manufacturing labor markets in developed OECD countries (a ten-country sample) over roughly 1970–1990 with focal windows like 1979–87 (US) and 1979–90 (UK). The unit of observation is industry- and plant-level employment shares (nonproduction = skilled vs production = unskilled) using UN industrial statistics, U.S. Census/ASM and worker–establishment matched data. The paper links pervasive, microprocessor‑related skill‑biased technological change to within‑industry increases in the proportion of skilled (nonproduction) workers, concentrated in machinery (& computers), electrical machinery, and printing & publishing.

# Target Context
This empirical study examines U.S. wage structure and returns to schooling across the long twentieth century (roughly 1890–1995), combining individual-level data (the 1915 Iowa State Census sample, IPUMS 1940–1960), matched manufacturing wage distributions (1890 vs. c.1940), and county-level agricultural outcomes (1915–1925). The units are workers, occupations, industries, and counties in the United States (with an Iowa case study). Analyses situate changes amid the high-school expansion, WWI, the Great Depression, WWII, immigration shifts, union activity, and labor-market regulation (e.g., FLSA).

It exploits cross-state and local variation in cigarette prices and excise taxes (including nearest-border prices) together with respondents' recalled past, current, and peak smoking to estimate dynamic demand and an addictive stock. The institutional setting highlights tax-driven price variation and health-policy relevance for current, former, and ever smokers.

Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Cigarette price
Outcome: Cigarette consumption
Context: This paper analyzes individual-level cigarette demand in the United States using NHANES II survey data collected 1976–1980 (adults up to age 74). It exploits cross-state and local variation in cigarette prices and excise taxes (including nearest-border prices) together with respondents' recalled past, current, and peak smoking to estimate dynamic demand and an addictive stock. The institutional setting highlights tax-driven price variation and health-policy relevance for current, former, and ever smokers.
Sign: None


# Target Context
This estimate pertains to U.S. teen smoking during 1991–1997 across states, using Monitoring the Future, YRBS, and Vital Statistics Natality data and exploiting within‑state over‑time variation in cigarette prices (prices instrumented with state excise taxes), with state and year fixed effects. The negative effect on smoking participation is concentrated among older teens (high‑school seniors); price effects are insignificant for younger teens.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Cigarette price
Outcome: Youth smoking participation

It exploits variation in legalization timing across states to measure post-legalization changes in state‑year birth rates (early 1970s onward), which the authors use to infer downstream impacts on cohort sizes reaching crime‑prone ages.

Context: This empirical study (early–mid 1990s) assembles legal-rule and enforcement data as of 1993–94 (accounting measures from 1991) for 49 countries worldwide (Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia) that had ≥5 domestic non‑financial publicly traded firms in 1993. The units are country-level legal provisions (company and bankruptcy law), enforcement and accounting-quality indices, and aggregated ownership stakes of large listed firms. The analysis exploits cross-country variation in legal origin (common law vs. French/German/Scandinavian civil law) to explain investor protections and ownership concentration.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper analyzes cross-country variation in investor protection and financial development using 49 countries (excluding recent socialist states) in the late 20th century. Rights measures are centered on laws circa 1993, enforcement indices are averaged through the 1980s–1995, and financial/openness measures use 1985–1995 averages. The unit of observation is the country; regressions examine how culture proxies (primary religion and language), legal origin (common vs. civil law), income per capita, and measures of trade openness relate to shareholder and creditor rights and their enforcement.

Regressions control for religion, ethnic fractionalization, years since independence, region, and include robustness checks instrumenting political-structure measures.

# Target Context
This paper analyzes cross-country effects of institutions using former European colonies (country-level units). Outcomes are mainly 1990s measures—GDP per capita (1995), investment rates (1990s), private credit (1998), and stock market capitalization (1990–95). It exploits historical variation from colonial-era determinants (European settler mortality and indigenous population density circa 1500) and legal origin imposed by colonizers to instrument for ""property rights"" (Political Risk Services, Polity IV) and ""contracting"" institutions (Djankov et al. legal formalism). The core assumption is that colonial history provides exogenous variation in contemporary institutions.

## Example 1
Treatment: Lagged current account deficit
Outcome: Probability of current account reversal
Context: Using an annual panel of 157 countries from roughly 1970–2001 (2,228 country-year observations), this paper studies how abrupt stops in capital inflows (“sudden stops”) and large current-account reversals affect national real GDP growth. Units are countries observed annually across world regions. Key institutional features include measures of financial openness (Quinn index), trade openness (exports+imports/GDP), reserve levels, external debt, short-term debt shares, and de-facto exchange-rate regimes; the analysis evaluates how capital-account restrictions and exchange-rate flexibility mediate crisis incidence and growth impacts.

Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Lagged current account deficit
Outcome: Probability of current account reversal
Context: Using an annual panel of 157 countries from roughly 1970–2001 (2,228 country-year observations), this paper studies how abrupt stops in capital inflows (“sudden stops”) and large current-account reversals affect national real GDP growth. Units are countries observed annually across world regions. Key institutional features include measures of financial openness (Quinn index), trade openness (exports+imports/GDP), reserve levels, external debt, short-term debt shares, and de-facto exchange-rate regimes; the analysis evaluates how capital-account restrictions and exchange-rate flexibility mediate crisis incidence and growth impacts.
Sign: None


# Target Context
Using annual country-year data for 157 countries over 1970–2001, this paper studies current-account imbalances, large deficit “reversals,” and “sudden stops.” The unit of observation is the country-year across six regions (industrial, Latin America/Caribbean, Asia, Africa, MENA, Eastern Europe). Analyses relate lagged external debt, reserves, short-term debt, and credit growth to reversal probability and estimate reversal impacts on GDP growth, contextualized by 1970s oil shocks, the 1980s debt crisis, 1990s currency crises, IMF programs, and varying exchange-rate/dollarization regimes.

Exploiting the institutional rule that most people become eligible for Medicare at age 65 (Part A/B availability subject to work-history rules), the authors estimate how the near-universal jump in coverage at 65 affects access, utilization, procedures, and self-reported and mortality outcomes for people just below and above 65.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair

Context: Paper examines the 1987 federal change that permitted U.S. states to raise rural interstate speed limits to 65 mph. Using state×roadtype×year data (primarily 1982–1993), it compares states that adopted 65 mph (21 states with complete post-1987 speed data) to those that retained 55 mph, focusing on fatality rates on rural interstates. The analysis contrasts pre/post changes across adopters and non-adopters with state and year/roadtype controls.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Tiebout choice
Outcome: Public school student achievement
Context: This paper empirically evaluates how variation in “Tiebout” choice across U.S. metropolitan areas affects student achievement, public/private enrollment, and district structure using late-1980s to early-1990s data (NELS base year 1987–88 with 1989–90 and 1991–92 follow-ups). Units of analysis include students, school districts, and metropolitan areas. The institutional setting is U.S. local public school districts (and private schools), exploiting historical geographic features (streams) and administrative data (Common Core, GNIS) that shaped district boundaries.

## Example 1
Treatment: Dividend tax increase
Outcome: Dividend payments
Context: This paper studies the 2013 French dividend payroll-tax reform that tripled the tax rate on dividends to owner-managers of SARL firms (from 15.5% to 46%). It uses administrative tax and accounting panel data covering the universe of private firms over 2008–2017. The unit of analysis is closely-held firms/owner-managers (SARL treated, SAS controls), exploiting legal-status variation and staggered fiscal-year treatment timing to estimate effects on payouts, retained earnings, capital and labor accumulation, revenues, and exit.
Sign: -

## Example 2
Treatment: 2003 dividend tax cut
Outcome: special dividend payments
Context: Using quarterly CRSP data from 1980–2004 Q1 on U.S. publicly traded firms (excluding utilities and financials), the paper examines how the 2003 dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced top individual dividend tax rates to 15% and applied retroactively to 2003) affected corporate payout behavior — regular vs. special dividends, initiations, terminations, and payment amounts — comparing pre- and post-2003 firm-level outcomes and contrasting responses with the 1986 tax reform.
Sign: -

## Example 3
Treatment: Dividend tax cut
Outcome: Dividend initiations and increases
Context: This paper studies U.S. publicly traded firms from 1993–2003 (≈1,700 firms), exploiting the unexpected May 2003 JGTRRA dividend tax cut (top dividend tax from ~38.6% to 15%, retroactive to Jan 1, 2003) to identify how executive stock ownership affects dividend initiations/increases and payout substitution between dividends and share repurchases. Using firm-level data (Compustat, CRSP, ExecuComp), the authors analyze cross-sectional and time variation in payout changes and stock-price reactions around legislative events to infer causal effects of the tax change on corporate payout policy.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Dividend tax cut
Outcome: Dividend initiations and increases
Context: This paper studies U.S. publicly traded firms from 1993–2003 (≈1,700 firms), exploiting the unexpected May 2003 JGTRRA dividend tax cut (top dividend tax from ~38.6% to 15%, retroactive to Jan 1, 2003) to identify how executive stock ownership affects dividend initiations/increases and payout substitution between dividends and share repurchases. Using firm-level data (Compustat, CRSP, ExecuComp), the authors analyze cross-sectional and time variation in payout changes and stock-price reactions around legislative events to infer causal effects of the tax change on corporate payout policy.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
Using quarterly data on U.S. publicly traded non-financial, non-utility firms (CRSP/Compustat, 1980–2004 Q2) this study exploits the 2003 U.S. dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, enacted mid‑2003 and made retroactive to 2003) to estimate causal effects on firm payout behavior. The unit of observation is the firm-quarter; outcomes include dividend initiations, terminations, increases, and special payouts. Analyses leverage cross‑firm heterogeneity (executive and institutional ownership), placebo comparisons (Canadian firms, nontaxable institutional owners), and quarterly event windows.

The authors combine 11 documented return anomalies to construct a cross-sectional mispricing ranking, adjust returns with Fama–French three-factor regressions, and use the Baker–Wurgler investor-sentiment index (and macro controls) to study time-varying mispricing and arbitrage asymmetry driven by short-sale impediments and arbitrage risk.

It analyzes annual gonorrhea rates by state (ages 15–19 and 20–24) from 1981–2001 and AIDS incidence in 103 large MSAs (ages 20–29 and 30–34) from 1982–2001, exploiting cross‑state and over‑time variation in beer excise taxes, percent dry counties, and BAC/zero‑tolerance laws; models include area and year fixed effects, lag structures (an 8‑year lag for AIDS), and dynamic panel methods.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair

## Example 1
Treatment: dividend tax cut
Outcome: dividend increases by existing payers
Context: Using quarterly data on U.S. publicly traded non-financial, non-utility firms (CRSP/Compustat, 1980–2004 Q2) this study exploits the 2003 U.S. dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, enacted mid‑2003 and made retroactive to 2003) to estimate causal effects on firm payout behavior. The unit of observation is the firm-quarter; outcomes include dividend initiations, terminations, increases, and special payouts. Analyses leverage cross‑firm heterogeneity (executive and institutional ownership), placebo comparisons (Canadian firms, nontaxable institutional owners), and quarterly event windows.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Tiebout choice
Outcome: average student performance
Context: Analyzes U.S. metropolitan school markets in the 1990s using student- and school-level data (NELS 8th graders surveyed 1988 with 1992 follow-up; SAT-takers from the 1994 cohort) and 1990 Census/MSA measures. Units are students, schools, and Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). The institutional setting is local public school districts (Tiebout-style residential choice between districts), and the paper studies how district market structure (a district-concentration choice index) relates to within-MSA sorting of peer-group composition and unobserved school effectiveness, and implications for incentives from school competition.

# Target Context
This paper empirically evaluates how variation in “Tiebout” choice across U.S. metropolitan areas affects student achievement, public/private enrollment, and district structure using late-1980s to early-1990s data (NELS base year 1987–88 with 1989–90 and 1991–92 follow-ups). Units of analysis include students, school districts, and metropolitan areas. The institutional setting is U.S. local public school districts (and private schools), exploiting historical geographic features (streams) and administrative data (Common Core, GNIS) that shaped district boundaries.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Zero tolerance law
Outcome: Gonorrhea rate
Context: Using U.S. state- and large-MSA-level panel data from the 1980s through 2001, the paper estimates how alcohol policies affect STD outcomes for teenagers and young adults. It analyzes annual gonorrhea rates by state (ages 15–19 and 20–24) from 1981–2001 and AIDS incidence in 103 large MSAs (ages 20–29 and 30–34) from 1982–2001, exploiting cross‑state and over‑time variation in beer excise taxes, percent dry counties, and BAC/zero‑tolerance laws; models include area and year fixed effects, lag structures (an 8‑year lag for AIDS), and dynamic panel methods.

Using county- and individual-level data on cohorts born in the 1960s–70s (mortality 1973–83, 1990 Census cohorts aged 18–24 born 1966–72, and NELS 1988 students), the authors compare outcomes across counties near the OEO poverty cutoff to estimate Head Start's impacts on child health and educational attainment.

Units are demographic labor groups (sex × education × experience, aggregated into 320/64 cells) with full-time weekly wages and total hours in efficiency units. The paper evaluates how shifts in relative supplies (education cohorts, age structure, female labor supply) and demand shifts — both within- and between-industry/occupation (skill-biased technology, product demand, trade) — generated movements in the college premium, experience returns, gender gaps, and within-group inequality.

The authors combine cross-sectional wage regressions, industry employment-change measures, and Oaxaca-style decompositions to evaluate explanations tied to product-demand/trade shocks, within-industry rent changes, technological bias, and changes in unobserved labor quality.

## Example 1
Treatment: Big business stability
Outcome: Per capita GDP growth
Context: This paper performs a cross-country empirical analysis of big business stability using lists of the ten largest employers in 1975 and their persistence to 1996 for 43 countries. Persistence measures consolidate firms into business groups and sometimes include state-controlled and foreign firms. The authors relate 1975–1996 firm persistence to economic growth and social outcomes (public goods, inequality, labor power) using country-level regressions controlling for log per-capita GDP (averaged 1996–2000), with social indicators averaged mainly over 1996–2000.

# Target Context
This paper studies the relationship between stability of the largest firms/business groups and long-run national economic growth across 44 countries. It constructs employment-weighted top‑10 firm stability indices using Dun & Bradstreet lists for circa 1975 and 1996, then relates these indexes to country-level per‑capita GDP, capital accumulation, and TFP growth over 1990–2000. Analyses control for 1990 initial income, physical and human capital and institutional features (state-controlled firms, legal origin, financial development, government size, and openness). Units are countries.

Context: Using restricted-access U.S. CPI micro data (Jan 1988–Jan 2012, main cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago), the paper studies monthly price changes for thousands of non-shelter product–outlet quote-lines to document how price-change dispersion and adjustment frequency vary over business cycles and recessions. It links these empirical facts to calibrated state-dependent (menu-cost) models with time-varying idiosyncratic volatility to assess implications for monetary (nominal) shocks and the inflation–output tradeoff in the U.S. economy.

Outcome: Price responsiveness to nominal shocks
Context: Using restricted-access U.S. CPI micro data (Jan 1988–Jan 2012, main cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago), the paper studies monthly price changes for thousands of non-shelter product–outlet quote-lines to document how price-change dispersion and adjustment frequency vary over business cycles and recessions. It links these empirical facts to calibrated state-dependent (menu-cost) models with time-varying idiosyncratic volatility to assess implications for monetary (nominal) shocks and the inflation–output tradeoff in the U.S. economy.

# Target Context
This paper uses a large U.S. monthly data set (1976:1–2005:6, with robustness checks for 1984:1–2005:6) to estimate how macroeconomic and sector-specific shocks — especially identified monetary policy shocks via the Federal funds rate — affect disaggregated prices and quantities. Units of observation are 190 disaggregated PCE price/consumption series and ~154 6‑digit NAICS PPI series plus 111 macro indicators. The institutional setting is U.S. monetary policy and industry structure; factor models summarize common macro dynamics.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Medicare eligibility
Outcome: Hospital admission rates
Context: This paper analyzes U.S. microdata—pooled NHIS (1992–2001) and BRFSS (1998–2002) surveys, state hospital discharge records (California and Florida, 1995–1999/2000), and national death files—to study individuals and hospital admissions around the Medicare eligibility cutoff. Exploiting the institutional rule that most people become eligible for Medicare at age 65 (Part A/B availability subject to work-history rules), the authors estimate how the near-universal jump in coverage at 65 affects access, utilization, procedures, and self-reported and mortality outcomes for people just below and above 65.

## Example 1
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper studies U.S. aggregate macroeconomic policy counterfactuals using identified monetary policy shocks and investment-specific technology news shocks applied to aggregate quarterly macro variables (output gap, inflation, short-term nominal rate). It combines semi-structural time-series evidence (e.g., Romer & Romer and Gertler & Karadi shock series) with a linearized model environment to construct Lucas-critique-robust counterfactuals and to characterize optimal monetary rules, emphasizing how the expected path of the policy instrument drives private-sector responses.
Sign: -

## Example 2
Treatment: Expansionary monetary shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: The paper examines how monetary policy shocks change aggregate TFP and resource allocation by reallocating inputs across heterogeneous firms. Empirical analyses use identified monetary shocks (Romer and Romer; high-frequency shocks) in U.S. time-series and panel contexts, and firm-level data (Compustat for U.S. public firms; Belgian firm-level pass-through estimates) across industries and years. Units are the aggregate economy and firms. The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.

It analyzes episodes including the Great Inflation (1960s–1980s), post‑1990s trends, the Great Recession, and the COVID‑19 recession and stimulus (CARES, ARPA), within the institutional setting of Federal Reserve monetary policy, fiscal transfers and debt maturity to assess funded versus partially unfunded fiscal shocks.

Context: Using U.S. quarterly post‑war macro data (approximately 1951Q1–2008Q4), the paper studies aggregate responses of households and firms (GDP, hours, unemployment, vacancies, wages, inflation, investment, etc.). It embeds search-and-matching labor market frictions and alternating-offer or Nash wage bargaining into a New Keynesian DSGE, and estimates parameters by matching model impulse responses to VAR-identified shocks (monetary policy, neutral TFP, investment‑specific TFP). The analysis includes policy experiments on unemployment benefits and scenarios with the zero lower bound.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: increase in unemployment benefits
Outcome: unemployment rate
Context: Using U.S. quarterly post‑war macro data (approximately 1951Q1–2008Q4), the paper studies aggregate responses of households and firms (GDP, hours, unemployment, vacancies, wages, inflation, investment, etc.). It embeds search-and-matching labor market frictions and alternating-offer or Nash wage bargaining into a New Keynesian DSGE, and estimates parameters by matching model impulse responses to VAR-identified shocks (monetary policy, neutral TFP, investment‑specific TFP). The analysis includes policy experiments on unemployment benefits and scenarios with the zero lower bound.

This paper analyzes corporate ownership dynamics using panel data on blockholdings and shares outstanding for 2,700 firms that went public between 1995 and 2006 across 34 countries. The unit of observation is publicly listed firms tracked from IPO and for several years thereafter. The analysis exploits cross-country variation in investor-protection (anti-self-dealing index; block premium), stock-market liquidity, and firm-level growth opportunities to study how legal and market institutions affect post-IPO dilution via share issuance and blockholder sales.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Stronger investor protection
Outcome: Ownership concentration

## Example 1
Treatment: Large non-CERP reconstruction spending
Outcome: Insurgent attacks per capita
Context: Using panel data from Feb 2004–Dec 2008/Feb 2009 on Iraq’s reconstruction, this paper studies effects of U.S. development spending across districts (N≈103) observed in half‑year intervals. It links IRMS project‑level spending (CERP, USAID CAP/CSP, large vs. small projects), troop strength (maneuver battalions), and Provincial Reconstruction Team presence to SIGACT insurgent‑incident rates, exploiting variation in timing, project size, local security, and implementation modality to evaluate when aid reduced violence during the Iraq war and U.S. counterinsurgency operations.

Context: Using a 20% administrative sample of U.S. Medicare Part D claims (2007–2010), the paper analyzes annual plan‑choice decisions of individual beneficiaries (age 65+) enrolled in stand‑alone PDPs without low‑income subsidies. The institutional setting is the Medicare Part D market with ~50 private plans, standardized ANOC notices, and automatic re‑enrollment defaults during annual open enrollment. The authors exploit forced choosers (new enrollees or discontinued plans) and year‑to‑year plan changes to estimate a structural two‑stage attention-and-switching‑costs panel discrete‑choice model and simulate interventions.

This paper studies Medicare Part D plan choices by U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ around the 2006 rollout, using 2005–2006 Wolters Kluwer longitudinal prescription claims matched to CMS plan menus. It focuses on individual elders’ choices among dozens of stand-alone PDPs (typical county choice set ≈40 plans) under the newly privatized Part D benefit (premiums, deductibles, copays, and “donut hole” rules), excluding dual eligibles and employer-sponsored plans, to evaluate whether seniors optimize given premiums, expected out-of-pocket costs, and risk.

Context: Using a 20% administrative sample of U.S. Medicare Part D claims (2007–2010), the paper analyzes annual plan‑choice decisions of individual beneficiaries (age 65+) enrolled in stand‑alone PDPs without low‑income subsidies. The institutional setting is the Medicare Part D market with ~50 private plans, standardized ANOC notices, and automatic re‑enrollment defaults during annual open enrollment. The authors exploit forced choosers (new enrollees or discontinued plans) and year‑to‑year plan changes to estimate a structural two‑stage attention-and-switching‑costs panel discrete‑choice model and simulate interventions.

Context: This paper examines US equity returns for individual stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ over roughly 1986–2000, using daily and monthly returns and the CBOE VIX as a proxy for aggregate volatility. The authors estimate firm-level sensitivities to VIX innovations with short-window daily regressions, form value-weighted portfolio sorts, construct a mimicking volatility factor, and use time-series alphas and Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions to test whether aggregate volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility are priced in the cross-section.

The authors combine 11 documented return anomalies to construct a cross-sectional mispricing ranking, adjust returns with Fama–French three-factor regressions, and use the Baker–Wurgler investor-sentiment index (and macro controls) to study time-varying mispricing and arbitrage asymmetry driven by short-sale impediments and arbitrage risk.

The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate).

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Realized volatility shock
Outcome: Output
Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Fiscal volatility shocks
Outcome: Hours worked
Context: Analyzes how time-varying uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy affects macro activity. The authors use quarterly consolidated government data (federal, state, local) on spending and average tax rates (labor, capital, consumption) from 1970:Q1–2010:Q2 to estimate fiscal rules with stochastic volatility. They then simulate a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model to compute impulse responses. The setting emphasizes elevated deficits and public debt after the 2008–09 financial crisis and uncertainty over the timing and mix of fiscal consolidation; units are aggregate fiscal instruments and macro aggregates.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Government spending increase
Outcome: Investment
Context: This paper uses U.S. quarterly macro data (1955q1–2014q2, with pre-Volcker and Great Moderation subperiods) to estimate a monetary DSGE model augmented with fiscal details—government consumption and transfers, maturity structure of nominal government debt, and steady-state distortionary taxes—to quantify government spending multipliers under two monetary–fiscal regimes (active monetary/passive fiscal and active fiscal/passive monetary). The unit is the aggregate U.S. economy; observables include output, consumption, investment, hours, wages, government consumption, market-value debt, inflation and the federal funds rate.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper uses U.S. annual national macro data (roughly 1912–2006, with main samples starting 1917/1930/1939/1950 and ending 2006) to estimate causal effects of government purchases—especially federal defense spending tied to WWI, WWII and the Korean War—and changes in average marginal income‑tax rates on per‑capita real GDP and its components. Units are national annual observations (per‑capita GDP, defense and non‑defense purchases, AMTR). Identification leverages war-driven exogenous variation, Ramey’s defense‑news, Romer‑Romer narrative tax shocks, and time‑series IV regressions.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Charter school attendance
Outcome: Test scores
Context: Using administrative data on roughly 28,000 Boston public school students (sixth graders) across 51 traditional, pilot, and charter schools during 2006–07 through 2013–14, the paper assesses school value-added. Boston’s centralized deferred-acceptance match and charter admissions use random tie-break lotteries and public lotteries, creating quasi-experimental assignment. Outcomes are standardized MCAS test scores (grade 6, with multi-grade analyses to grade 8); analyses exploit lottery-induced random offers, OLS value-added models, and hierarchical estimation to study selection bias and causal school effects.

In the U.S. corporate setting (primarily non‑financial, non‑utility public firms), it links measured managerial miscalibration to firm investment, M&A announcement returns, capital structure, dividend, and repurchase policies using archival accounting and market data.

- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Managerial overconfidence
Outcome: Debt leverage
Context: This paper uses quarterly surveys of U.S. senior finance executives (mostly CFOs) from March 2001 to June 2007 to elicit one- and ten‑year S&P 500 return distributions (10th/90th percentiles) and matches many firm-identified responses to Compustat/CRSP. In the U.S. corporate setting (primarily non‑financial, non‑utility public firms), it links measured managerial miscalibration to firm investment, M&A announcement returns, capital structure, dividend, and repurchase policies using archival accounting and market data.
Sign: None


# Target Context
This triplet is estimated for U.S. large publicly traded firms in the paper’s primary sample (roughly 477 firms, 1980–1994). Managerial overconfidence is proxied by the Longholder measure (delayed exercise of in-the-money executive options). The outcome is net debt issuance per dollar of financing deficit, measured from Compustat (including private financing) and estimated via the Shyam-Sunder & Myers (1999) financing-deficit panel regression comparing CEOs to their predecessors/successors within firms.

It matches state/MSA residential and commercial price indices to firm headquarters, emphasizing firms that own real estate as pledgeable collateral. The institutional setting is U.S. credit markets; identification exploits national mortgage rate movements interacting with local housing‑supply constraints to generate exogenous local price variation.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Increase in collateral value
Outcome: Net debt issues

Using individual microdata (Census/IPUMS and ACS) aggregated to commuting‑zone × decade groups (1990–2000 and 2000–2007), it estimates effects of group‑level changes in Chinese imports per worker, exploiting variation in local manufacturing exposure and instrumenting via a shift‑share measure based on changes in Chinese imports to other countries.
Sign: None


# Target Context
This paper uses firm- and plant-level panels (up to half a million firms; IT establishment sample ≈160,000) across 12 European countries over 1996–2007 to estimate how rising Chinese import competition — especially after China’s 2001 WTO accession and the phased abolition of textile/apparel quotas (MFA reforms in 2002 and 2005) — affected firm innovation (patents, R&D), IT adoption, TFP, employment and survival. Identification exploits differential industry exposure to quota removal and pre-existing Chinese export shares, with firm and industry fixed effects and trend controls.

Context: This paper estimates a small-scale New Keynesian DSGE with an explicit zero lower bound and Markov sunspot shocks for the United States and Japan using quarterly country-level macro data (output growth, GDP deflator inflation, and short-term nominal rates). Estimation uses pre-ZLB samples (U.S. 1984:Q1–2007:Q4; Japan 1981:Q1–1994:Q4) and post-sample filtering through 2013 to detect regime switches around ZLB episodes (Japan’s prolonged 1990s–2000s deflation; U.S. Great Recession starting 2008). The paper conducts structural counterfactual fiscal policy experiments and simulations.

# Target Context
This paper analyzes U.S. quarterly aggregate data from 1975:Q1 to 2010:Q4 to quantify how shocks to land (housing) demand and collateral conditions propagate to investment, output, hours, and consumption. The unit of analysis is the aggregate macro time series (real land price, investment price, per-capita consumption and investment, business debt, hours) representing representative households and entrepreneurs/firms. The setting emphasizes collateralized business lending with land as a key collateral asset, financial frictions, and the Great Recession housing-price collapse; the authors estimate a DSGE model and run historical counterfactuals.

Treatment: Realized volatility shock
Outcome: Investment
Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.
Sign: mixed

## Example 2
Treatment: Real interest rate volatility
Outcome: Investment
Context: Study of how time-varying volatility of real interest rates affects real activity in four emerging small open economies (Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil) using monthly data roughly 1994–2008 (EMBI series from ~1997–2008 for most countries). Unit of analysis is country-level macro aggregates and USD borrowing spreads (T-bill plus EMBI). Authors estimate stochastic-volatility AR(1) processes via particle filter and Bayesian methods and feed the estimated volatility processes into a calibrated small-open-economy DSGE to quantify causal real effects of volatility shocks.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
Analyzes how time-varying uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy affects macro activity. The authors use quarterly consolidated government data (federal, state, local) on spending and average tax rates (labor, capital, consumption) from 1970:Q1–2010:Q2 to estimate fiscal rules with stochastic volatility. They then simulate a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model to compute impulse responses. The setting emphasizes elevated deficits and public debt after the 2008–09 financial crisis and uncertainty over the timing and mix of fiscal consolidation; units are aggregate fiscal instruments and macro aggregates.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Number of vacancies
Outcome: Job-filling rate
Context: This analysis uses pooled 2001–2006 JOLTS microdata aggregated to industry × establishment-size cells (cell-level units) to estimate employer-level hiring technology linking vacancies to job-filling rates. The preferred specification is a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression of log job-filling rates on log vacancy flows (average vacancy flow per establishment), instrumenting vacancy flows with total employment in the industry–size cell and including industry and size fixed effects.

- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Adding a management layer
Outcome: Average wage in preexisting layers
Context: This paper studies Portuguese manufacturing firms (firm and firm-product-year units) over the 1995–2005 period (matched employer–employee, balance-sheet, and firm-product data, excluding 2001). It examines how changes in organizational structure (adding/dropping management layers inferred from occupations) respond to exogenous demand/cost shocks and affect quantity-based versus revenue-based productivity. Analyses exploit industry shocks (notably quota removals after China’s WTO entry), firm export/import patterns, real exchange rates, and model-based estimates of past shocks to support causal interpretations.

It examines issuance incidence, security design (maturity, secured), and uses of proceeds to distinguish credit‑supply versus information‑demand channels.

# Target Context
This paper studies US nonfinancial firms’ debt-maturity choices and the term structure of credit spreads over the business cycle by combining a dynamic capital-structure model with empirical tests. It uses aggregate Flow of Funds evidence (1952–2010), firm-level Compustat/CRSP panel data (1974–2010), and corporate bond/CDS data (2004–2010) to analyze firms (the unit) in US corporate debt markets. The setting exploits variation in macro states (expansions vs. recessions), firms’ systematic risk (asset betas), leverage, and bond liquidity to study causal links between beta, maturity choice, and credit spreads.

## Example 1
Treatment: Idiosyncratic volatility
Outcome: Expected stock returns
Context: The paper analyzes U.S. equity markets (CRSP/Compustat: NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ) over July 1962–December 2005 at the individual firm/stock level. For this triplet, the authors document a significant positive relation between idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns conditional on controlling for prior-month extreme positive returns (MAX), using equal-weighted portfolio sorts and Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions with Newey–West t-statistics and standard controls (size, BM, momentum, reversal, liquidity, skewness).

## Example 2
Treatment: Idiosyncratic volatility
Outcome: Average stock returns
Context: This paper examines US equity returns for individual stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ over roughly 1986–2000, using daily and monthly returns and the CBOE VIX as a proxy for aggregate volatility. The authors estimate firm-level sensitivities to VIX innovations with short-window daily regressions, form value-weighted portfolio sorts, construct a mimicking volatility factor, and use time-series alphas and Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions to test whether aggregate volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility are priced in the cross-section.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Idiosyncratic volatility
Outcome: Expected stock returns
Context: The paper analyzes U.S. equity markets (CRSP/Compustat: NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ) over July 1962–December 2005 at the individual firm/stock level. For this triplet, the authors document a significant positive relation between idiosyncratic volatility and expected returns conditional on controlling for prior-month extreme positive returns (MAX), using equal-weighted portfolio sorts and Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions with Newey–West t-statistics and standard controls (size, BM, momentum, reversal, liquidity, skewness).
Sign: None

## Example 2
Treatment: Idiosyncratic volatility
Outcome: Average stock returns
Context: This paper examines US equity returns for individual stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ over roughly 1986–2000, using daily and monthly returns and the CBOE VIX as a proxy for aggregate volatility. The authors estimate firm-level sensitivities to VIX innovations with short-window daily regressions, form value-weighted portfolio sorts, construct a mimicking volatility factor, and use time-series alphas and Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions to test whether aggregate volatility risk and idiosyncratic volatility are priced in the cross-section.
Sign: None


# Target Context
This paper studies U.S. equity markets from August 1965 to January 2011, using individual common stocks and value-weighted portfolios to examine how idiosyncratic volatility relates to average returns. The authors combine 11 documented return anomalies to construct a cross-sectional mispricing ranking, adjust returns with Fama–French three-factor regressions, and use the Baker–Wurgler investor-sentiment index (and macro controls) to study time-varying mispricing and arbitrage asymmetry driven by short-sale impediments and arbitrage risk.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Balanced-budget defense spending increase
Outcome: Real GDP
Context: This paper uses U.S. annual national macro data (roughly 1912–2006, with main samples starting 1917/1930/1939/1950 and ending 2006) to estimate causal effects of government purchases—especially federal defense spending tied to WWI, WWII and the Korean War—and changes in average marginal income‑tax rates on per‑capita real GDP and its components. Units are national annual observations (per‑capita GDP, defense and non‑defense purchases, AMTR). Identification leverages war-driven exogenous variation, Ramey’s defense‑news, Romer‑Romer narrative tax shocks, and time‑series IV regressions.

Using consolidated financial statements for the subsample of 1,215 acquirers, the authors estimate panel regressions with firm fixed effects, year dummies, and country-level financing controls and find that acquirer cash holdings decline after acquisitions; they also construct an “adjusted” acquirer cash measure (adding back purchase price for deals with Zephyr deal values) to rule out payment-driven declines.

Using restricted-access U.S. CPI micro data (Jan 1988–Jan 2012, main cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago), the paper studies monthly price changes for thousands of non-shelter product–outlet quote-lines to document how price-change dispersion and adjustment frequency vary over business cycles and recessions. It links these empirical facts to calibrated state-dependent (menu-cost) models with time-varying idiosyncratic volatility to assess implications for monetary (nominal) shocks and the inflation–output tradeoff in the U.S. economy.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Higher volatility
Outcome: Price responsiveness to nominal shocks

You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions

- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Average marginal income-tax rate increase
Outcome: Real GDP
Context: Estimates refer to U.S. annual national per‑capita real GDP for a post‑1950 sample (1950–2006). The treatment is changes in a newly constructed average marginal income‑tax rate (AMTR); the reported effect uses the lagged change in AMTR (Δτ_{t-1}) on next year’s per‑capita real GDP, treating lagged tax‑rate changes as predetermined. The paper also discusses using the Romer‑Romer narrative ""exogenous"" tax‑revenue series as an instrument for contemporaneous tax changes, but the main negative effect reported applies to the post‑1950 sample.
Sign: -

## Example 2
Treatment: Tax cuts
Outcome: Real GDP
Context: Analyzes interwar Britain (primarily 1918–1938) at the national (UK) level, using quarterly aggregates constructed from annual Budget Financial Statements and Hansard to collect nearly 300 discrete tax legislations and classify 140 as exogenous. Units are macro quarterly outcomes (real GDP, unemployment, prices, Bank Rate) and tax changes measured as percent of GDP. The institutional setting features high post‑WWI debt, Gold Standard debates, budgetary orthodoxy, Chancellor Budget motives, and episodic rearmament that shape tax policy timing.
Sign: -

## Example 3
Treatment: Tax changes for bottom 90%
Outcome: Real GDP
Context: This paper uses U.S. federal income and payroll tax changes from the postwar period (1950–2011, with state analyses mainly 1980–2007) and state-level variation in income distributions to construct regional tax shocks by income group (bottom 90% vs top 10%). Units are state-year observations aggregated from individual tax returns via NBER TAXSIM; main outcomes are state employment, GDP, payrolls, wages and consumption. The analysis focuses on exogenous federal tax changes (per Romer & Romer 2010), exploiting cross-state exposure heterogeneity and panel variation while controlling for social-insurance policy changes.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions

- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Housing demand shock
Outcome: Output
Context: This paper analyzes U.S. quarterly aggregate data from 1975:Q1 to 2010:Q4 to quantify how shocks to land (housing) demand and collateral conditions propagate to investment, output, hours, and consumption. The unit of analysis is the aggregate macro time series (real land price, investment price, per-capita consumption and investment, business debt, hours) representing representative households and entrepreneurs/firms. The setting emphasizes collateralized business lending with land as a key collateral asset, financial frictions, and the Great Recession housing-price collapse; the authors estimate a DSGE model and run historical counterfactuals.
Sign: -

## Example 2
Treatment: Expansionary monetary shock
Outcome: Output
Context: The paper examines how monetary policy shocks change aggregate TFP and resource allocation by reallocating inputs across heterogeneous firms. Empirical analyses use identified monetary shocks (Romer and Romer; high-frequency shocks) in U.S. time-series and panel contexts, and firm-level data (Compustat for U.S. public firms; Belgian firm-level pass-through estimates) across industries and years. Units are the aggregate economy and firms. The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.
Sign: -


# Target Context
This paper estimates a small-scale New Keynesian DSGE with an explicit zero lower bound and Markov sunspot shocks for the United States and Japan using quarterly country-level macro data (output growth, GDP deflator inflation, and short-term nominal rates).

You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Teacher value-added
Outcome: Probability of teenage birth
Context: This paper links administrative test-score and classroom assignment records for grades 3–8 in a large U.S. urban school district (1989–2009) to U.S. tax records (1996–2010) to follow cohorts who graduate by 2008 into early adulthood. The unit of observation is the student-year and classroom/teacher; outcomes include earnings, college attendance and neighborhood SES. The analysis evaluates causal effects of teacher value‑added using institutional variation in teacher assignments and turnover, rich lagged-score controls, and an environment without high‑stakes VA incentives.

## Example 1
Treatment: Higher macroeconomic uncertainty
Outcome: Employment
Context: Using two survey waves in New Zealand (first wave June–Oct 2021, follow-up Nov 2021–Feb 2022), the authors survey ~4,000 firms (about 2,000 reinterviewed) employing ≥6 workers. They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period. Outcomes include firms' planned and realized prices, employment, investment, sales, advertising, and decisions to adopt technologies or open facilities.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Increase in inflation expectations
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper uses two survey waves of New Zealand firms (initial: 2017Q4–2018Q1, follow‑up: 2018Q1–2018Q2) with a fresh sample of 1,025 firm managers (≥6 employees) and 515 reinterviews three months later. Respondents across manufacturing, professional/financial services and other sectors received randomized information treatments (average first‑order beliefs, average higher‑order beliefs, both, or past inflation). The study measures causal effects of these RCT treatments on managers’ first‑ and higher‑order inflation expectations and, via IV and panel regressions, on firm decisions (employment, investment, prices, wages).
Sign: +

## Example 3
Treatment: Policy uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.

# Target Context
This paper estimates time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States using monthly macro and financial series (1960:01–2011:12) and a quarterly firm-level panel of 155 firms (1970:Q1–2011:Q2).

They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period. Outcomes include firms' planned and realized prices, employment, investment, sales, advertising, and decisions to adopt technologies or open facilities.
Sign: None

## Example 2
Treatment: Increase in inflation expectations
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper uses two survey waves of New Zealand firms (initial: 2017Q4–2018Q1, follow‑up: 2018Q1–2018Q2) with a fresh sample of 1,025 firm managers (≥6 employees) and 515 reinterviews three months later. Respondents across manufacturing, professional/financial services and other sectors received randomized information treatments (average first‑order beliefs, average higher‑order beliefs, both, or past inflation). The study measures causal effects of these RCT treatments on managers’ first‑ and higher‑order inflation expectations and, via IV and panel regressions, on firm decisions (employment, investment, prices, wages).
Sign: None

## Example 3
Treatment: Policy uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.

# Target Context
This paper estimates time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States using monthly macro and financial series (1960:01–2011:12) and a quarterly firm-level panel of 155 firms (1970:Q1–2011:Q2). Units include 132 macro series and 147 financial series as predictors and firm-level profit-growth observations. Using diffusion-index forecasts, latent factors, and stochastic-volatility models, the authors construct aggregate uncertainty measures and identify uncertainty shocks via VARs with recursive (Cholesky) ordering to study effects on industrial production, employment, and hours across major episodes (e.g., 1973–74, 1981–82, 2007–09).

Context: This cross-country study analyzes country-level effects of the mid-20th-century “international epidemiological transition” (primarily 1940–1980) across about 59 countries (decadal country-year observations). The unit is the country; outcomes include life expectancy, population, total births, GDP and GDP per capita. Identification exploits exogenous timing of global health interventions (e.g., antibiotics, DDT, WHO campaigns) interacted with pre-1940 disease-specific mortality rates. The core institutional background is the global diffusion of medical and public-health technologies after WWII and resulting differential mortality declines by baseline disease burden.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Life expectancy
Outcome: GDP per capita
Context: This cross-country study analyzes country-level effects of the mid-20th-century “international epidemiological transition” (primarily 1940–1980) across about 59 countries (decadal country-year observations). The unit is the country; outcomes include life expectancy, population, total births, GDP and GDP per capita. Identification exploits exogenous timing of global health interventions (e.g., antibiotics, DDT, WHO campaigns) interacted with pre-1940 disease-specific mortality rates. The core institutional background is the global diffusion of medical and public-health technologies after WWII and resulting differential mortality declines by baseline disease burden.

Context: Using newly constructed spatially disaggregated data for 1801–1921, this paper studies Greater London (parish and borough level) and its residents, workers and bilateral commuting flows to assess how the mid‑19th‑century steam railway revolution (first passenger line 1836) reorganized workplaces and residences. The setting features private, uncoordinated railway construction, low pre‑rail travel speeds, limited metropolitan planning (pre‑MBW/LCC), and administrative rateable land values; analyses use 1921 bilateral commuting as a baseline to recover historical employment and run counterfactuals.

# Target Context
This paper studies Berlin’s internal city structure across 1936, 1986 and 2006 using block-level data on land prices, workplace and residence employment and commuting. It exploits the exogenous shock of the Berlin Wall (1961) severing interactions between East and West Berlin and the 1989–1990 fall and reunification as a natural experiment. Units are thousands of statistical blocks within Berlin; outcomes include land values, employment distributions and commuting flows. The institutional setting involves travel-cost barriers, transport-network closures, and West Berlin’s market economy during division.

Treatment: Financial aid
Outcome: Educational attainment
Context: This paper studies U.S. parent–child pairs (siblings) to test borrowing constraints for higher education, combining a theoretical model with empirical analysis using Health and Retirement Study cohorts (parents born c.1931–1947; children with median 18th birthday 1977) and NLSY‑97 validation. Empirical data span HRS waves 1992–2004 with post‑college cash transfers aggregated 1998–2004 and a 1994 retrospective module; institutional context is U.S. federal financial aid (FAFSA/EFC rules and the MISAA 1978 expansion).

Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper analyzes an 18-month randomized early childhood intervention in central Colombia (started early 2010) targeting disadvantaged children aged 12–24 months at baseline drawn from beneficiaries of the Familias en Acción CCT program. The cluster RCT randomized 96 municipalities into psychosocial stimulation, micronutrient, combined, or control arms; home visits were delivered by local community “Madre Líderes.” Outcomes are child cognitive and socio-emotional development and parental material and time investments measured at baseline and immediately after the intervention (children ≈30–42 months).

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Fund turnover
Outcome: Fund tax burden
Context: This paper studies U.S. domestic equity mutual funds using fund-year data primarily from 1993–1998 (≈5,866 fund-years), with a smaller 1994–1998 sample for gross inflow/outflow analysis and an institutional-fund subsample. Units are individual mutual funds; data come from Morningstar and SEC filings. The institutional setting is the U.S. personal income tax system: authors construct after-tax (buy-and-hold) returns for hypothetical upper-income investors (assumed dividend/short-term tax 31%, long-term gains 20%, 10% effective accrual tax on unrealized gains) and analyze how after-tax returns and capital-gains overhangs predict fund inflows and redemptions.

Treatment: Trade liberalization
Outcome: Welfare
Context: This paper develops a heterogeneous-firm trade model with firm-level distortions and structurally estimates it using Chinese manufacturing microdata (annual firm surveys for 1998–2007, emphasizing 2005) to quantify welfare effects of trade liberalization associated with China’s early-2000s opening to trade. The unit of observation is individual manufacturing firms (sales, inputs, exports). The institutional setting includes pervasive firm-specific output and export wedges (taxes/subsidies), heterogeneous fixed exporting costs, and large trade costs; the authors calibrate joint distributions of productivity and wedges and simulate autarky-to-open transitions.

# Target Context
The paper calibrates a dynamic spatial growth model to global data around 2000 (G-Econ, transport networks, Gallup World Poll) at 1°×1° grid-cell resolution and simulates centuries of evolution (up to ~600 years). Units are grid cells and countries (agents = workers/firms) whose location choices face trade costs, local amenities, innovation diffusion, and migration quotas.

# Target Context
This paper uses U.S. quarterly macro data (1955q1–2014q2, with pre-Volcker and Great Moderation subperiods) to estimate a monetary DSGE model augmented with fiscal details—government consumption and transfers, maturity structure of nominal government debt, and steady-state distortionary taxes—to quantify government spending multipliers under two monetary–fiscal regimes (active monetary/passive fiscal and active fiscal/passive monetary). The unit is the aggregate U.S. economy; observables include output, consumption, investment, hours, wages, government consumption, market-value debt, inflation and the federal funds rate.

## Example 1
Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Using U.S. publicly listed firm-year data (main 1993–2019; extended OLS sample 1965–2019), the paper studies how firm-level uncertainty shocks—measured by realized and option-implied stock-return volatility—affect investment, employment, sales and firms’ financial policies. Identification exploits industry-level exposures to oil, seven major currencies, and economic policy uncertainty as instruments. Analyses span U.S. industries, contrast periods of heightened aggregate financial frictions (e.g., 2008–09), and compare firms with differing ex-ante financial constraints, controlling for firm and year fixed effects.

## Example 4

Units include 132 macro series and 147 financial series as predictors and firm-level profit-growth observations. Using diffusion-index forecasts, latent factors, and stochastic-volatility models, the authors construct aggregate uncertainty measures and identify uncertainty shocks via VARs with recursive (Cholesky) ordering to study effects on industrial production, employment, and hours across major episodes (e.g., 1973–74, 1981–82, 2007–09).

They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period.

Context: Using two survey waves in New Zealand (first wave June–Oct 2021, follow-up Nov 2021–Feb 2022), the authors survey ~4,000 firms (about 2,000 reinterviewed) employing ≥6 workers. They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period. Outcomes include firms' planned and realized prices, employment, investment, sales, advertising, and decisions to adopt technologies or open facilities.

# Target Context
This paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.

Treatment: Pilot school attendance
Outcome: Student achievement (test scores)
Context: This paper evaluates the causal impact of attending Boston charter and pilot public schools using student-level administrative and MCAS test-score data from roughly 2001–2008. The unit of analysis is individual Boston Public School students (elementary, middle, and high school cohorts). The study exploits randomized admissions lotteries at over-subscribed charter and some pilot schools as a quasi-experiment, compares lottery-based IV estimates to observational regressions with baseline scores and demographics, and situates findings in Massachusetts’ charter/pilot institutional setting (union rules, charter caps).

Context: Using administrative data on roughly 28,000 Boston public school students (sixth graders) across 51 traditional, pilot, and charter schools during 2006–07 through 2013–14, the paper assesses school value-added. Boston’s centralized deferred-acceptance match and charter admissions use random tie-break lotteries and public lotteries, creating quasi-experimental assignment. Outcomes are standardized MCAS test scores (grade 6, with multi-grade analyses to grade 8); analyses exploit lottery-induced random offers, OLS value-added models, and hierarchical estimation to study selection bias and causal school effects.

The study exploits randomized admissions lotteries at over-subscribed charter and some pilot schools as a quasi-experiment, compares lottery-based IV estimates to observational regressions with baseline scores and demographics, and situates findings in Massachusetts’ charter/pilot institutional setting (union rules, charter caps).

# Target Context
Using administrative data on roughly 28,000 Boston public school students (sixth graders) across 51 traditional, pilot, and charter schools during 2006–07 through 2013–14, the paper assesses school value-added. Boston’s centralized deferred-acceptance match and charter admissions use random tie-break lotteries and public lotteries, creating quasi-experimental assignment. Outcomes are standardized MCAS test scores (grade 6, with multi-grade analyses to grade 8); analyses exploit lottery-induced random offers, OLS value-added models, and hierarchical estimation to study selection bias and causal school effects.

## Example 1
Treatment: Charter school attendance
Outcome: Student achievement (test scores)
Context: The paper develops theory for propensity scores under deferred‑acceptance assignment and applies it to estimate charter school effects using centralized SchoolChoice data from Denver Public Schools. Analyses use first‑round DA lotteries for the 2011–12 applicant cohort (assignments for 2012–13) for students enrolled in grades 3–9 at baseline, exploiting DA’s single‑lottery tie‑breaker, school priorities and bucketed seats. The institutional setting integrates charter and traditional schools; outcomes are student test scores and sector enrollment, using lottery‑based offers as quasi‑random instruments.

The study documents how firm size, value added, and export entry relate to changes in hierarchical layers, employment by layer, and the wage distribution, exploiting firm panel variation and within-firm transitions in layers and export status in the French manufacturing sector.

# Target Context
This paper studies Portuguese manufacturing firms (firm and firm-product-year units) over the 1995–2005 period (matched employer–employee, balance-sheet, and firm-product data, excluding 2001). It examines how changes in organizational structure (adding/dropping management layers inferred from occupations) respond to exogenous demand/cost shocks and affect quantity-based versus revenue-based productivity. Analyses exploit industry shocks (notably quota removals after China’s WTO entry), firm export/import patterns, real exchange rates, and model-based estimates of past shocks to support causal interpretations.

Context: Combining theory and micro-evidence, the paper studies Belgian manufacturing exporters using firm-product-destination-year customs and registry data for 2000–2008 (National Bank of Belgium). It links firms’ import intensity (by source country, inside vs outside the Euro Area) and destination-specific market shares to heterogeneous exchange-rate pass-through into producer export unit values, exploiting within-industry–destination variation and rich fixed effects across non‑Euro OECD destinations.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This triplet refers to industry-level analysis in Belgian manufacturing (1995–2007) across roughly 160 NACE 4-digit industries: the authors use firm-product–level data (domestic unit prices, firm marginal costs, detailed imported inputs, and competitor prices) to calibrate an equilibrium model of variable markups and match average industry exchange-rate pass-through (ERPT). They study how industry-average import intensity of domestic firms (and within-industry firm heterogeneity and foreign firms' market shares) predicts industry-level ERPT.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Pretrial release
Outcome: Probability of conviction
Context: The paper develops a test of identifying assumptions for judge fixed-effects instrumental-variable designs and applies it to criminal cases in Miami-Dade County (2006–2014). The unit is defendants at weekend bail hearings, where rotating assignment creates variation in bail-judge leniency; treatment is pretrial release (release within three days) and the primary outcome is conviction. The setting uses leave-out mean judge leniency instruments, examines exclusion/monotonicity assumptions, and complements empirical IV estimates with simulations and subgroup first-stage checks.
Sign: None

Context: This paper studies Massachusetts' subsidized insurance exchange ""CommCare"" from 2009–2013, focusing on fiscal year 2011. It uses individual-level administrative enrollment, claims, and reported income (% of FPL) for non-elderly adults (ages 19–64) eligible between 135–300% of the federal poverty level who lacked employer or Medicaid coverage. CommCare's subsidy schedule produced discrete premium jumps at 150%, 200%, and 250% FPL (and an individual mandate with penalties); these institutional discontinuities identify causal effects of enrollee premiums on take-up, selection, and insurer costs.

This empirical study analyzes U.S. individual bankruptcy filers (aged ~23–47 at filing) who filed between 1995–2004, exploiting that credit bureaus voluntarily remove Chapter 13 bankruptcy flags after seven years but Chapter 7 flags after ten. Using Equifax CCP credit-bureau panels (1999–2015) and matched Social Security administrative earnings records (available through 2014), the authors estimate how flag removal (roughly 2002–2011 removals) affects credit scores, credit-card and mortgage borrowing, and formal labor-market outcomes within the FCRA credit-reporting institutional setting.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Removal of Chapter 13 bankruptcy flag

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Removal of Chapter 13 bankruptcy flag
Outcome: Self-employment
Context: This empirical study analyzes U.S. individual bankruptcy filers (aged ~23–47 at filing) who filed between 1995–2004, exploiting that credit bureaus voluntarily remove Chapter 13 bankruptcy flags after seven years but Chapter 7 flags after ten. Using Equifax CCP credit-bureau panels (1999–2015) and matched Social Security administrative earnings records (available through 2014), the authors estimate how flag removal (roughly 2002–2011 removals) affects credit scores, credit-card and mortgage borrowing, and formal labor-market outcomes within the FCRA credit-reporting institutional setting.

Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Real interest rate volatility
Outcome: Output
Context: Study of how time-varying volatility of real interest rates affects real activity in four emerging small open economies (Argentina, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil) using monthly data roughly 1994–2008 (EMBI series from ~1997–2008 for most countries). Unit of analysis is country-level macro aggregates and USD borrowing spreads (T-bill plus EMBI). Authors estimate stochastic-volatility AR(1) processes via particle filter and Bayesian methods and feed the estimated volatility processes into a calibrated small-open-economy DSGE to quantify causal real effects of volatility shocks.
Sign: +


# Target Context
Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.

## Example 1
Treatment: Fiscal volatility shocks
Outcome: Consumption
Context: Analyzes how time-varying uncertainty about U.S. fiscal policy affects macro activity. The authors use quarterly consolidated government data (federal, state, local) on spending and average tax rates (labor, capital, consumption) from 1970:Q1–2010:Q2 to estimate fiscal rules with stochastic volatility. They then simulate a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model to compute impulse responses. The setting emphasizes elevated deficits and public debt after the 2008–09 financial crisis and uncertainty over the timing and mix of fiscal consolidation; units are aggregate fiscal instruments and macro aggregates.

Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Using U.S. publicly listed firm-year data (main 1993–2019; extended OLS sample 1965–2019), the paper studies how firm-level uncertainty shocks—measured by realized and option-implied stock-return volatility—affect investment, employment, sales and firms’ financial policies. Identification exploits industry-level exposures to oil, seven major currencies, and economic policy uncertainty as instruments. Analyses span U.S. industries, contrast periods of heightened aggregate financial frictions (e.g., 2008–09), and compare firms with differing ex-ante financial constraints, controlling for firm and year fixed effects.

## Example 2
Treatment: Policy uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.

# Target Context
Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.

Units include state-year aggregates (Vital Statistics infant outcomes) and individual women aged 15–44 (CPS, NLSY). It exploits cross-state, over-time variation from targeted AFDC-linked expansions in the early 1980s and broader income-based expansions (1987–1990, e.g. 133%–185% FPL) to assess effects on low birthweight, infant mortality, Medicaid take-up, service use, and program expenditures.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper studies U.S. cohorts born 1975–1988 (first generation) and their children born 1990–2017 (second generation), exploiting 1980s state-level expansions in prenatal Medicaid eligibility. Using restricted Vital Statistics natality files linked to mothers’ state and year of birth and simulated eligibility from CPS and state Medicaid rules collected back to 1975, the authors compare individuals across U.S. states and cohorts (by state/year of birth) to estimate how in utero access to Medicaid affected infant health across generations.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Prenatal Medicaid eligibility expansions
Outcome: First generation low birthweight incidence

- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Job displacement
Outcome: Daily wages
Context: This paper uses linked employer–employee social security records from West Germany spanning roughly 1975–2009 (AKM estimates 1979–2009) to study male workers (age 24–50) displaced in mass‑layoffs (≥30% employment declines or plant closings) at establishments with ≥50 employees. It exploits matched non‑displaced controls, event‑study and difference‑in‑differences comparisons, and establishment fixed‑effects (AKM) to analyze earnings, employment, and wage losses and their cyclicality across multiple recessions within the German unemployment‑insurance institutional setting.

## Example 1
Treatment: Fintech loan
Outcome: Loan default probability
Context: Using individual-level monthly credit-bureau data from the U.S. (2012–2017), this study compares unsecured personal loans originated by online fintech firms and traditional lenders. The unit is the loan/borrower (monthly panel spanning 3 months pre- to 15 months post-origination) across U.S. zip codes and states. Fintechs are defined as non-deposit, online-only, recently founded lenders; the institutional background includes rising fintech market share and regulation primarily by state regulators/CFPB. Analyses exploit local time variation and lender switching to infer causal effects on defaults, balances, and pricing.

## Example 1
Treatment: Uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond). The unit is the aggregate stock market and macro aggregates (industrial production, employment, Fed funds rate). The paper contrasts realized volatility with forward-looking uncertainty (VIX-like measures), uses VAR-based news-shock identification and asset-pricing (variance-swap) evidence, and validates identification with simulated structural models featuring negatively skewed technology shocks.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Policy uncertainty shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.
Sign: +

## Example 3
Treatment: Realized volatility shock

Context: Monthly U.S. aggregate data are analyzed (daily S&P 500 returns aggregated to months, option-implied volatilities from 1983 onward, macro series through the 2008 crisis and beyond).

Sign: +

## Example 4
Treatment: Demand shock
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper uses postwar quarterly macro data for the US (1948–1994) and other G7 countries (samples vary, typically 1960s–1994) at the country level, using aggregate GDP, employment (or hours), and labor productivity to decompose fluctuations into technology versus demand/monetary shocks under structural VAR identification with long‑run restrictions; the setting compares predictions of RBC versus sticky‑price imperfect‑competition models and evaluates how identified shocks drive employment and productivity.

They analyze direct and indirect effects on employment, output and investment across 2003–2007 (expansion), 2008–2009 (financial crisis) and 2010–2013 (recession).

# Target Context
This paper analyzes U.S. macroeconomic quarterly data (1955–2017) using a ten-variable VAR/VECM (unemployment, per-capita GDP, investment, consumption, hours, productivity measures, labor share, inflation, federal funds rate) to identify shocks operating at business-cycle (6–32 quarters) and long-run frequencies. The units are aggregate U.S. time series; the study examines pre/post‑Volcker and Great Recession/ZLB periods, evaluates frequency-domain SVAR “max-share” shocks, and uses Bayesian VAR estimation and medium-scale DSGE model simulations to assess propagation mechanisms.

## Example 1
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper studies U.S. aggregate macroeconomic policy counterfactuals using identified monetary policy shocks and investment-specific technology news shocks applied to aggregate quarterly macro variables (output gap, inflation, short-term nominal rate). It combines semi-structural time-series evidence (e.g., Romer & Romer and Gertler & Karadi shock series) with a linearized model environment to construct Lucas-critique-robust counterfactuals and to characterize optimal monetary rules, emphasizing how the expected path of the policy instrument drives private-sector responses.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This triplet refers to model-generated impulse responses in the paper’s two‑country Calvo sticky‑price framework (local‑currency pricing, staggered price setting, home‑bias preferences and Taylor‑rule monetary policy). In model simulations (Figure 6), a positive home monetary policy shock raises home consumption and, through higher demand, causes home CPI inflation to increase; both variables then return monotonically to steady state.
Sign: +

## Example 3
Treatment: Expansionary monetary shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: The paper examines how monetary policy shocks change aggregate TFP and resource allocation by reallocating inputs across heterogeneous firms. Empirical analyses use identified monetary shocks (Romer and Romer; high-frequency shocks) in U.S. time-series and panel contexts, and firm-level data (Compustat for U.S. public firms; Belgian firm-level pass-through estimates) across industries and years. Units are the aggregate economy and firms. The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: teacher performance pay
Outcome: student test scores (math & language)
Context: This paper reports a randomized evaluation (2005–07) of teacher performance pay in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. The authors randomized 500 sampled government primary schools (focus on 300 schools: 100 group-incentive, 100 individual-incentive, 100 control) across 50 mandals, following baseline tests in June–July 2005 and endline tests in March–April 2006 and 2007. Units are pupils (grades 1–5), teachers, and schools. The intervention paid teacher bonuses (≈3% of annual pay) based on average student test-score improvements, in a setting with low learning, high teacher absence, and civil-service pay rules.

Context: Using the Bank of Italy quarterly Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations (SIGE) and linked administrative data (CCR, INPS, CADS), the paper studies a panel of Italian non-financial firms (50+ employees) from 2012 onward (treatment introduced in 2012Q3; ELB-focused subperiod 2014Q4–2018Q2).

## Example 2
Treatment: Increase in macroeconomic uncertainty
Outcome: Employment
Context: This paper estimates time-varying macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States using monthly macro and financial series (1960:01–2011:12) and a quarterly firm-level panel of 155 firms (1970:Q1–2011:Q2). Units include 132 macro series and 147 financial series as predictors and firm-level profit-growth observations. Using diffusion-index forecasts, latent factors, and stochastic-volatility models, the authors construct aggregate uncertainty measures and identify uncertainty shocks via VARs with recursive (Cholesky) ordering to study effects on industrial production, employment, and hours across major episodes (e.g., 1973–74, 1981–82, 2007–09).

Treatment: Workplace employment density
Outcome: Productivity
Context: This paper studies Berlin’s internal city structure across 1936, 1986 and 2006 using block-level data on land prices, workplace and residence employment and commuting. It exploits the exogenous shock of the Berlin Wall (1961) severing interactions between East and West Berlin and the 1989–1990 fall and reunification as a natural experiment. Units are thousands of statistical blocks within Berlin; outcomes include land values, employment distributions and commuting flows. The institutional setting involves travel-cost barriers, transport-network closures, and West Berlin’s market economy during division.

The setting features private, uncoordinated railway construction, low pre‑rail travel speeds, limited metropolitan planning (pre‑MBW/LCC), and administrative rateable land values; analyses use 1921 bilateral commuting as a baseline to recover historical employment and run counterfactuals.

Context: This paper studies Berlin’s internal city structure across 1936, 1986 and 2006 using block-level data on land prices, workplace and residence employment and commuting. It exploits the exogenous shock of the Berlin Wall (1961) severing interactions between East and West Berlin and the 1989–1990 fall and reunification as a natural experiment. Units are thousands of statistical blocks within Berlin; outcomes include land values, employment distributions and commuting flows. The institutional setting involves travel-cost barriers, transport-network closures, and West Berlin’s market economy during division.

# Target Context
Using newly constructed spatially disaggregated data for 1801–1921, this paper studies Greater London (parish and borough level) and its residents, workers and bilateral commuting flows to assess how the mid‑19th‑century steam railway revolution (first passenger line 1836) reorganized workplaces and residences. The setting features private, uncoordinated railway construction, low pre‑rail travel speeds, limited metropolitan planning (pre‑MBW/LCC), and administrative rateable land values; analyses use 1921 bilateral commuting as a baseline to recover historical employment and run counterfactuals.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Increase in inflation expectations
Outcome: Fixed assets (investment)
Context: This paper uses two survey waves of New Zealand firms (initial: 2017Q4–2018Q1, follow‑up: 2018Q1–2018Q2) with a fresh sample of 1,025 firm managers (≥6 employees) and 515 reinterviews three months later. Respondents across manufacturing, professional/financial services and other sectors received randomized information treatments (average first‑order beliefs, average higher‑order beliefs, both, or past inflation). The study measures causal effects of these RCT treatments on managers’ first‑ and higher‑order inflation expectations and, via IV and panel regressions, on firm decisions (employment, investment, prices, wages).

Using the Bank of Italy quarterly Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations (SIGE) and linked administrative data (CCR, INPS, CADS), the paper studies a panel of Italian non-financial firms (50+ employees) from 2012 onward (treatment introduced in 2012Q3; ELB-focused subperiod 2014Q4–2018Q2). A randomized information treatment telling firms recent Italian/Euro-area inflation generated exogenous, time-varying variation in firms’ inflation expectations; the authors analyze causal effects on firm prices, employment, investment and credit in a low-inflation, effective-lower-bound policy environment.

## Example 1
Treatment: UI benefit exhaustion
Outcome: new job finding hazard
Context: Using Austrian social security administrative records for involuntary job losses from 1981–2001, the paper analyzes about 92,969 individuals aged 20–50 to study exit hazards around unemployment insurance (UI) benefit exhaustion. Austria’s UI rules provide 20 or 30 weeks of benefits depending on months worked in the prior five years (36-month threshold), alongside severance pay rules and means-tested post-exhaustion assistance. The analysis contrasts registered-unemployment duration and time-to-next-job (including recalls) to assess whether spikes at benefit expiration reflect true re-employment or exits from the register.

You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Main Business Cycle shock
Outcome: Investment
Context: This paper analyzes U.S. macroeconomic quarterly data (1955–2017) using a ten-variable VAR/VECM (unemployment, per-capita GDP, investment, consumption, hours, productivity measures, labor share, inflation, federal funds rate) to identify shocks operating at business-cycle (6–32 quarters) and long-run frequencies. The units are aggregate U.S. time series; the study examines pre/post‑Volcker and Great Recession/ZLB periods, evaluates frequency-domain SVAR “max-share” shocks, and uses Bayesian VAR estimation and medium-scale DSGE model simulations to assess propagation mechanisms.

It exploits quasi‑random rotation of bail judges in two large U.S. counties—bail hearings occur within 24 hours, judges set ROR, non‑monetary or monetary bail, and bail judges are distinct from trial judges—to instrument for pre‑trial release and examine impacts on convictions, recidivism, formal employment, and tax‑benefit take‑up.

The paper develops a test of identifying assumptions for judge fixed-effects instrumental-variable designs and applies it to criminal cases in Miami-Dade County (2006–2014). The unit is defendants at weekend bail hearings, where rotating assignment creates variation in bail-judge leniency; treatment is pretrial release (release within three days) and the primary outcome is conviction. The setting uses leave-out mean judge leniency instruments, examines exclusion/monotonicity assumptions, and complements empirical IV estimates with simulations and subgroup first-stage checks.

Context: This empirical study links administrative court records (Philadelphia County 2007–2014; Miami‑Dade County 2006–2014) for over 420,000 criminal defendants to IRS tax records to estimate causal effects of pre‑trial detention. It exploits quasi‑random rotation of bail judges in two large U.S. counties—bail hearings occur within 24 hours, judges set ROR, non‑monetary or monetary bail, and bail judges are distinct from trial judges—to instrument for pre‑trial release and examine impacts on convictions, recidivism, formal employment, and tax‑benefit take‑up.

The analysis uses eligible poor rural households (low landholdings, reported skipping meals) surveyed pre-intervention (2008), during 2008–09, and in a longer-run follow-up in 2011 (and some 2013 data). The setting examines spillovers of migration incentives on informal village risk-sharing and welfare, and combines RCT variation with a structural model estimation.

Treatment: Migration subsidy
Outcome: Household consumption (ITT)
Context: This paper studies rural–urban migration in northern Bangladesh using randomized migration-subsidy experiments conducted in the Rangpur region (notably a 2008 RCT with follow-ups and a larger 2014 replication). Units are poor, landless rural households observed around the lean-season (Monga); interventions were small travel subsidies (~800 Taka) encouraging seasonal migration. The authors combine RCT variation and national HIES data to estimate a dynamic incomplete-markets structural model of seasonal and permanent migration with seasonal income cycles, stochastic shocks, limited insurance, and migration disutility.

The authors estimate a heterogeneous‑firms trade model (Melitz-style) by the method of simulated moments and run general‑equilibrium counterfactuals (e.g., lower trade barriers or entry costs) to quantify effects on firm sales, exits, and welfare.
Sign: mixed

## Example 2
Treatment: Fully liberalizing migration
Outcome: Welfare
Context: The paper calibrates a dynamic spatial growth model to global data around 2000 (G-Econ, transport networks, Gallup World Poll) at 1°×1° grid-cell resolution and simulates centuries of evolution (up to ~600 years). Units are grid cells and countries (agents = workers/firms) whose location choices face trade costs, local amenities, innovation diffusion, and migration quotas. Using this calibrated framework the authors evaluate causal counterfactuals: relaxing international migration restrictions (partial to full liberalization) and coastal flooding scenarios (e.g., 1–6 meter sea-level rise) to quantify welfare and productivity impacts.
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper develops a heterogeneous-firm trade model with firm-level distortions and structurally estimates it using Chinese manufacturing microdata (annual firm surveys for 1998–2007, emphasizing 2005) to quantify welfare effects of trade liberalization associated with China’s early-2000s opening to trade. The unit of observation is individual manufacturing firms (sales, inputs, exports). The institutional setting includes pervasive firm-specific output and export wedges (taxes/subsidies), heterogeneous fixed exporting costs, and large trade costs; the authors calibrate joint distributions of productivity and wedges and simulate autarky-to-open transitions.

This paper studies long-term causal effects of childhood access to the U.S. Food Stamps (SNAP) program that rolled out across counties from 1961–1975. Using linked 2000 Census and 2001–2013 ACS data merged to the SSA NUMIDENT for individuals born 1950–1980 (observed as adults, roughly ages 25–54), the authors exploit county-by-county staggered adoption under the War on Poverty to estimate how in utero and early-childhood exposure (especially conception to age five) affected adult education, earnings, health, incarceration, and neighborhood outcomes across U.S. counties.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair

Treatment: Food Stamp Program exposure in early childhood
Outcome: Economic self-sufficiency (women)
Context: This paper studies long-run effects of childhood exposure to the U.S. Food Stamp Program, exploiting county-by-county rollout from 1961–1975. Using individuals born 1956–1981 observed in the PSID, it links county-of-birth month/year to adult health and economic outcomes measured through 2009, focusing on disadvantaged families (parent < high school). The institutional setting is the federal Food Stamp/SNAP expansion, with treatment defined as the share of months exposed between conception and age five.

Context: This paper studies U.S. monthly data on Federal Reserve internal ""Green Book"" forecasts (1965–1991) and commercial forecasts (Blue Chip, DRI, SPF), focusing empirically on periods 1974:9–1979:9 and 1984:3–1991:12. Units are monthly forecast observations and forecast errors for the GDP deflator and real GDP; institutional setting is FOMC policy meetings, federal funds rate target changes, and press-reported Fed actions. The analysis tests whether Fed private information is signaled by monetary actions and causes revisions in market inflation expectations and the term structure.

This paper examines U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy announcements and their informational content using monthly Blue Chip forecast revisions, thirty-minute high-frequency futures changes around FOMC meetings, and financial-market responses from January 1990 through June 2019 (with subsamples such as 1995–2014 and 1990–2007). Units of analysis are FOMC announcement events and Blue Chip forecasters (panel ≈50 firms), supplemented by market-price observations and comparisons to Fed Greenbook forecasts. The institutional setting is the U.S. FOMC (rate decisions, statements, dot plots, SEP) and public macro news releases.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Monetary policy tightening
Outcome: Commercial inflation forecasts (revisions)
Context: This paper studies U.S. monthly data on Federal Reserve internal ""Green Book"" forecasts (1965–1991) and commercial forecasts (Blue Chip, DRI, SPF), focusing empirically on periods 1974:9–1979:9 and 1984:3–1991:12. Units are monthly forecast observations and forecast errors for the GDP deflator and real GDP; institutional setting is FOMC policy meetings, federal funds rate target changes, and press-reported Fed actions. The analysis tests whether Fed private information is signaled by monetary actions and causes revisions in market inflation expectations and the term structure.

Context: Using 333,626 English-language earnings-call transcripts for 12,952 publicly listed firms headquartered in 82 countries (January 2002–December 2020), the paper studies firm-level effects of epidemic outbreaks—focusing on COVID-19 in 2020 and comparing SARS, H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and MERS. The unit is the firm-quarter (and earnings-call sentence triples); outcomes include stock returns (quarterly and three-day event windows), realized volatility, investment, and employment. The setting is the global corporate sector facing the aggregate COVID-19 shock, with text-based exposure, sentiment, and risk measures constructed from calls.

The unit is the firm-quarter (and earnings-call sentence triples); outcomes include stock returns (quarterly and three-day event windows), realized volatility, investment, and employment. The setting is the global corporate sector facing the aggregate COVID-19 shock, with text-based exposure, sentiment, and risk measures constructed from calls.

# Target Context
This paper analyzes weekly stock returns of over 6,000 publicly listed firms in 56 countries during the first quarter of 2020 (weeks Jan 2–Mar 27, 2020), relating firm-level pre-2020 characteristics (cash, leverage, profitability, international supplier/customer exposure, CSR, governance, ownership) to weekly growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Using firm, industry-by-week, and country-by-week controls, it studies how the pandemic’s epidemiological shock and country responses revalued firms across global supply chains and institutional settings.

Using individual-level monthly credit-bureau data from the U.S. (2012–2017), this study compares unsecured personal loans originated by online fintech firms and traditional lenders. The unit is the loan/borrower (monthly panel spanning 3 months pre- to 15 months post-origination) across U.S. zip codes and states. Fintechs are defined as non-deposit, online-only, recently founded lenders; the institutional background includes rising fintech market share and regulation primarily by state regulators/CFPB. Analyses exploit local time variation and lender switching to infer causal effects on defaults, balances, and pricing.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Fintech loan
Outcome: Loan default probability

Empirical analyses use identified monetary shocks (Romer and Romer; high-frequency shocks) in U.S. time-series and panel contexts, and firm-level data (Compustat for U.S. public firms; Belgian firm-level pass-through estimates) across industries and years. Units are the aggregate economy and firms. The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.

# Task
You are given examples in which the same or comparable treatment–outcome pair is observed across multiple contexts, potentially with different causal signs.
Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions

- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This triplet refers to model-generated impulse responses in the paper’s two‑country Calvo sticky‑price framework (local‑currency pricing, staggered price setting, home‑bias preferences and Taylor‑rule monetary policy). In model simulations (Figure 6), a positive home monetary policy shock raises home consumption and, through higher demand, causes home CPI inflation to increase; both variables then return monotonically to steady state.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper studies U.S. aggregate macroeconomic policy counterfactuals using identified monetary policy shocks and investment-specific technology news shocks applied to aggregate quarterly macro variables (output gap, inflation, short-term nominal rate). It combines semi-structural time-series evidence (e.g., Romer & Romer and Gertler & Karadi shock series) with a linearized model environment to construct Lucas-critique-robust counterfactuals and to characterize optimal monetary rules, emphasizing how the expected path of the policy instrument drives private-sector responses.
Sign: +

## Example 3
Treatment: Positive demand shocks
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper estimates a small-scale New Keynesian DSGE with an explicit zero lower bound and Markov sunspot shocks for the United States and Japan using quarterly country-level macro data. In the model's deflation regime (sunspot state s=0) — the regime the authors link to prolonged Japanese deflation — positive demand shocks generate a negative comovement of detrended output and inflation (inflation falls), because demand shocks explain the majority of fluctuations in the simulated economy.
Sign: +

## Example 4
Treatment: Main Business Cycle shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper analyzes U.S. macroeconomic quarterly data (1955–2017) using a ten-variable VAR/VECM (unemployment, per-capita GDP, investment, consumption, hours, productivity measures, labor share, inflation, federal funds rate) to identify shocks operating at business-cycle (6–32 quarters) and long-run frequencies. The units are aggregate U.S. time series; the study examines pre/post‑Volcker and Great Recession/ZLB periods, evaluates frequency-domain SVAR “max-share” shocks, and uses Bayesian VAR estimation and medium-scale DSGE model simulations to assess propagation mechanisms.
Sign: +

## Example 5
Treatment: Unfunded fiscal shocks
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper studies the U.S. macroeconomy from 1960:Q1 through 2022:Q3, using aggregate quarterly series (GDP, consumption, investment, hours, inflation, real and nominal interest rates, transfers, government consumption, debt/GDP and breakeven inflation). It analyzes episodes including the Great Inflation (1960s–1980s), post‑1990s trends, the Great Recession, and the COVID‑19 recession and stimulus (CARES, ARPA), within the institutional setting of Federal Reserve monetary policy, fiscal transfers and debt maturity to assess funded versus partially unfunded fiscal shocks.

- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Winning a lottery prize
Outcome: Self-employment income
Context: This paper studies causal effects of exogenous wealth shocks from Swedish lottery prizes (draws covering 1986–2010) across three lotteries (PLS, Kombi, Triss). Units are individual winners and their spouses aged 21–64; outcomes (wages, hours, gross/after-tax earnings, self-employment) come from Swedish administrative tax and employer registers (analysis window mainly 1991–2010). Identification exploits randomized assignment of prize amounts within lottery “cells” (draws/ticket-count groups) and incorporates institutional features like tax treatment and retirement rules.

Predict the most likely sign for the treatment–outcome pair in the target context.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: dividend tax cut
Outcome: dividend payments
Context: Using quarterly data on U.S. publicly traded non-financial, non-utility firms (CRSP/Compustat, 1980–2004 Q2) this study exploits the 2003 U.S. dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, enacted mid‑2003 and made retroactive to 2003) to estimate causal effects on firm payout behavior. The unit of observation is the firm-quarter; outcomes include dividend initiations, terminations, increases, and special payouts. Analyses leverage cross‑firm heterogeneity (executive and institutional ownership), placebo comparisons (Canadian firms, nontaxable institutional owners), and quarterly event windows. 
Sign: mixed


# Target Context
This paper studies the 2013 French dividend payroll-tax reform that tripled the tax rate on dividends to owner-managers of SARL firms (from 15.5% to 46%). It uses administrative tax and accounting panel data covering the universe of private firms over 2008–2017. The unit of analysis is closely-held firms/owner-managers (SARL treated, SAS controls), exploiting legal-status variation and staggered fiscal-year treatment timing to estimate effects on payouts, retained earnings, capital and labor accumulation, revenues, and exit.

# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Dividend tax increase

Treatment: Job displacement
Outcome: Quarterly earnings
Context: Using linked employer–employee UI records for Washington State (2002–2014), this paper examines long-tenure workers displaced during the Great Recession (separations mainly 2008–2010). The unit is individual workers observed quarterly (primary-employer earnings and hours); Washington’s UI data uniquely report quarterly paid hours. The analysis exploits mass-layoff timing and a comparison group of long-tenure non-displaced workers to identify causal effects of displacement on earnings, decomposing outcomes into hours, hourly wages, employer fixed effects, and worker–employer match effects.

The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.

# Target Context
Using two survey waves in New Zealand (first wave June–Oct 2021, follow-up Nov 2021–Feb 2022), the authors survey ~4,000 firms (about 2,000 reinterviewed) employing ≥6 workers. They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period. Outcomes include firms' planned and realized prices, employment, investment, sales, advertising, and decisions to adopt technologies or open facilities.

# Reference Examples
## Example 1
Treatment: Monetary policy shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This triplet refers to model-generated impulse responses in the paper’s two‑country Calvo sticky‑price framework (local‑currency pricing, staggered price setting, home‑bias preferences and Taylor‑rule monetary policy). In model simulations (Figure 6), a positive home monetary policy shock raises home consumption and, through higher demand, causes home CPI inflation to increase; both variables then return monotonically to steady state.
Sign: +

## Example 2
Treatment: Expansionary monetary shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: The paper examines how monetary policy shocks change aggregate TFP and resource allocation by reallocating inputs across heterogeneous firms. Empirical analyses use identified monetary shocks (Romer and Romer; high-frequency shocks) in U.S. time-series and panel contexts, and firm-level data (Compustat for U.S. public firms; Belgian firm-level pass-through estimates) across industries and years. Units are the aggregate economy and firms. The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.
Sign: +

## Example 3
Treatment: Main Business Cycle shock
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper analyzes U.S. macroeconomic quarterly data (1955–2017) using a ten-variable VAR/VECM (unemployment, per-capita GDP, investment, consumption, hours, productivity measures, labor share, inflation, federal funds rate) to identify shocks operating at business-cycle (6–32 quarters) and long-run frequencies. The units are aggregate U.S. time series; the study examines pre/post‑Volcker and Great Recession/ZLB periods, evaluates frequency-domain SVAR “max-share” shocks, and uses Bayesian VAR estimation and medium-scale DSGE model simulations to assess propagation mechanisms.
Sign: +

## Example 4
Treatment: Unfunded fiscal shocks
Outcome: Inflation
Context: This paper studies the U.S. macroeconomy from 1960:Q1 through 2022:Q3, using aggregate quarterly series (GDP, consumption, investment, hours, inflation, real and nominal interest rates, transfers, government consumption, debt/GDP and breakeven inflation). It analyzes episodes including the Great Inflation (1960s–1980s), post‑1990s trends, the Great Recession, and the COVID‑19 recession and stimulus (CARES, ARPA), within the institutional setting of Federal Reserve monetary policy, fiscal transfers and debt maturity to assess funded versus partially unfunded fiscal shocks.

The setting emphasizes nominal rigidities (Calvo/menu costs), heterogeneous markups and pass-throughs, and monetary and discount-factor shocks as exogenous demand disturbances.

# Target Context
This paper studies the U.S. macroeconomy from 1960:Q1 through 2022:Q3, using aggregate quarterly series (GDP, consumption, investment, hours, inflation, real and nominal interest rates, transfers, government consumption, debt/GDP and breakeven inflation). It analyzes episodes including the Great Inflation (1960s–1980s), post‑1990s trends, the Great Recession, and the COVID‑19 recession and stimulus (CARES, ARPA), within the institutional setting of Federal Reserve monetary policy, fiscal transfers and debt maturity to assess funded versus partially unfunded fiscal shocks.
