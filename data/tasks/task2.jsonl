Units of analysis are FOMC announcement events and Blue Chip forecasters (panel ≈50 firms), supplemented by market-price observations and comparisons to Fed Greenbook forecasts. The institutional setting is the U.S. FOMC (rate decisions, statements, dot plots, SEP) and public macro news releases.\nSign: -\n\n\n# Target Context\nThis paper studies U.S. monthly data on Federal Reserve internal \"Green Book\" forecasts (1965–1991) and commercial forecasts (Blue Chip, DRI, SPF), focusing empirically on periods 1974:9–1979:9 and 1984:3–1991:12. Units are monthly forecast observations and forecast errors for the GDP deflator and real GDP; institutional setting is FOMC policy meetings, federal funds rate target changes, and press-reported Fed actions. The analysis tests whether Fed private information is signaled by monetary actions and causes revisions in market inflation expectations and the term structure.\n\n# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair\nTreatment: Monetary policy tightening\nOutcome: Commercial inflation forecasts (revisions)\n\n# Output Format\nRespond with a JSON object containing:\n- predicted_sign: \"+\", \"-\", \"None\", or \"mixed\"\n- reasoning: A concise explanation of your reasoning\n", "answer": "+"}

The treatment is changes in a newly constructed average marginal income‑tax rate (AMTR); the reported effect uses the lagged change in AMTR (Δτ_{t-1}) on next year’s per‑capita real GDP, treating lagged tax‑rate changes as predetermined.

Units include 132 macro series and 147 financial series as predictors and firm-level profit-growth observations. Using diffusion-index forecasts, latent factors, and stochastic-volatility models, the authors construct aggregate uncertainty measures and identify uncertainty shocks via VARs with recursive (Cholesky) ordering to study effects on industrial production, employment, and hours across major episodes (e.g., 1973–74, 1981–82, 2007–09).\nSign: -\n\n## Example 5\nTreatment: Higher macroeconomic uncertainty\nOutcome: Employment\nContext: Using two survey waves in New Zealand (first wave June–Oct 2021, follow-up Nov 2021–Feb 2022), the authors survey ~4,000 firms (about 2,000 reinterviewed) employing ≥6 workers. They randomized information treatments that provided professional forecasters' mean GDP forecasts and/or the spread between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts to exogenously shift firms' macroeconomic first- and second-moment beliefs during the pandemic period. Outcomes include firms' planned and realized prices, employment, investment, sales, advertising, and decisions to adopt technologies or open facilities.\nSign: -\n\n\n# Target Context\nThis paper constructs newspaper-based Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices and uses them to estimate effects on US publicly listed firms, industry sectors, and macro aggregates. Analyses focus mainly on 1985–2012 monthly/daily newspaper coverage (with historical extensions back to 1900) and firm-level panels (1996–2012 for option-implied volatility; 1985–2012 for investment and employment), exploiting cross-firm heterogeneity in exposure to federal government purchases. The authors also estimate monthly VARs for the US and a 12-country panel VAR to assess dynamic responses to EPU shocks from elections, wars, and fiscal/regulatory battles.\n\n# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair\nTreatment: Policy uncertainty shock\nOutcome: Employment\n\n# Output Format\nRespond with a JSON object containing:\n- predicted_sign: \"+\", \"-\", \"None\", or \"mixed\"\n- reasoning: A concise explanation of your reasoning\n", "answer": "-"}

Units are firms (≈1.8M) and banks (≈235); authors construct year-by-year bank–year supply shocks via matched employer–employee high-dimensional fixed effects and combine firm balance sheets with 2010 input–output tables to measure downstream/upstream exposure. They analyze direct and indirect effects on employment, output and investment across 2003–2007 (expansion), 2008–2009 (financial crisis) and 2010–2013 (recession).\nSign: +\n\n\n# Target Context\nThis paper analyzes quarterly country-level data on real GDP growth and realized equity-market volatility for 32 advanced and emerging economies (covering >90% of world GDP) over 1993:Q1–2011:Q2. Units are country-quarter observations. Combining a multi-country Lucas-tree model with empirical factor-augmented VARs and cross-sectional factor estimation, the study assumes a pervasive global ‘real’ growth factor and an additional common ‘financial’ factor in volatilities to separate global versus country-specific shocks and quantify their effects on growth and volatility.\n\n# Target Treatment–Outcome Pair\nTreatment: Financial factor shocks\nOutcome: Output growth\n\n# Output Format\nRespond with a JSON object containing:\n- predicted_sign: \"+\", \"-\", \"None\", or \"mixed\"\n- reasoning: A concise explanation of your reasoning\n", "answer": "-"}

It combines semi-structural time-series evidence (e.g., Romer & Romer and Gertler & Karadi shock series) with a linearized model environment to construct Lucas-critique-robust counterfactuals and to characterize optimal monetary rules, emphasizing how the expected path of the policy instrument drives private-sector responses.\nSign: -\n\n## Example 2\nTreatment: Monetary policy shock\nOutcome: Inflation\nContext: This triplet refers to model-generated impulse responses in the paper’s two‑country Calvo sticky‑price framework (local‑currency pricing, staggered price setting, home‑bias preferences and Taylor‑rule monetary policy).
