Using County Business Patterns employment, payroll, and establishment data for 170 U.S. Standard Metropolitan Areas, the paper examines growth of the top six 2‑digit industries in each city between 1956 and 1987 (≈1,016 city‑industry observations). It assesses how local specialization, competition (establishments per worker), and urban variety predict 30‑year employment and wage growth, controlling for initial employment and wages, southern location, and national industry trends, to test MAR, Porter, and Jacobs theories of knowledge spillovers.

This paper analyzes US manufacturing wage determination using CPS March microdata for roughly 400,000 workers aggregated into 19 industry-by-year cells over 1964–1985. Industry-level profit and unemployment series (profit data available 1958–1985, aggregated to 2-digit SIC) are merged with cell means of individual characteristics to test rent-sharing versus competitive and contract models. Estimations use dynamic panel specifications with year dummies and both fixed- and random-effects to trace contemporaneous and lagged profit effects on mean wages.

Given a context and a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
This paper uses a U.S. panel of matched individual income tax returns to estimate how the 1986 Tax Reform Act's reductions in marginal income tax rates affected taxable income. It compares taxpayers' returns in 1985 and 1988 (pre/post reform), focusing on married joint filers (mostly under age 65) in a Treasury random sample of roughly 4,000–5,000 returns, and accounts for contemporaneous rule changes (capital gains inclusion, Subchapter C→S conversions, passive loss limits) to isolate behavioral responses in labor, compensation form, portfolio choices, deductions, and reporting.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: High marginal tax rates
Outcome: Deadweight losses

Units are AMI treatment episodes and patients; the institutional backdrop includes shifting payment systems (fee-for-service, Medicare prospective payment/DRGs), rising use of invasive procedures (catheterization, angioplasty, bypass), and evolving list vs. transaction prices alongside quality (survival) improvements.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Improvements in AMI treatment and survival
Outcome: Real Cost of Living Index

# Context
This paper studies the effects of the 1970 and 1977 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments on manufacturing using plant-level Census of Manufactures data from 1967–1987. It exploits county-level, pollutant-specific attainment/nonattainment designations for four criteria pollutants across 3,070 counties and 1.75 million plant observations; polluting plants in nonattainment counties faced stricter plant-specific regulation. The unit of analysis is individual manufacturing plants; identification leverages cross-sectional and temporal variation in county nonattainment status and industry emitting status to estimate regulation impacts on employment, capital, and shipments.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: CO nonattainment designation
Outcome: Shipments

# Context
This paper uses U.S. aggregate annual data (primarily 1947–1997) to study how capital income taxation affects the wedge between expected pre-tax returns on the capital stock and consumption growth. Units are national aggregates—BEA measures of pre-tax and after-tax capital returns, per-capita nondurable and services consumption, and capital-income tax revenue (federal, state, local). The analysis relies on consumption Euler equations, VARs to form expectations, and TSLS estimates to infer capital supply elasticity and tax incidence in the mid-to-late 20th century United States.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: After-tax capital return

# Context
Using quarterly CRSP data from 1980–2004 Q1 on U.S. publicly traded firms (excluding utilities and financials), the paper examines how the 2003 dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced top individual dividend tax rates to 15% and applied retroactively to 2003) affected corporate payout behavior — regular vs. special dividends, initiations, terminations, and payment amounts — comparing pre- and post-2003 firm-level outcomes and contrasting responses with the 1986 tax reform.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: 2003 dividend tax cut

Focuses on the U.S. national external portfolio (quarterly, 1952:Q1–2004:Q1). For this triplet the authors consider the case where U.S. gross assets are denominated in foreign currencies while gross liabilities are in domestic (dollar) currency; they show theoretically that, holding local-currency asset returns constant, a domestic-currency depreciation raises the dollar return on gross foreign assets, an effect amplified by portfolio leverage (|µa|>1) and net of domestic inflation.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Currency depreciation
Outcome: Return on gross foreign assets

Using U.S. postwar annual data from 1946–2012, the paper studies tax-unit–level reported market incomes across the income distribution (top 1%, top 5%, bottom 90%, etc.) and aggregate macro outcomes. It constructs average marginal tax rate series (income and payroll taxes) and narrative scores of exogenous federal tax reforms (Romer–Romer style) to isolate surprise marginal-rate innovations, and estimates dynamic effects of these shocks on reported incomes, GDP, unemployment, and income sources.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Average tax rate decline without marginal change
Outcome: Reported incomes

The institutional setting is England’s national assessments, small primary classes, and non‑selective secondary admissions (≈87% new peers), exploited to estimate long‑run effects of primary‑school ordinal rank conditional on test scores.

It uses a newly assembled panel of 11,575 U.S. war-contractor applicant firms (1935–1955 financials), primarily large manufacturers (covering ~40% of 1939 manufacturing employment), exploiting voluntary application windows, decentralized subdistrict implementation, and variation in instructor assignment. Eligibility required an active war contract; outcomes are firm-level sales, TFP, profitability, managerial practices, and supply-chain links.

The paper studies the effect of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) of 1999—which required U.S. patent applications filed on or after Nov 29, 2000 to be published 18 months after filing—on innovation and knowledge diffusion. Using patent applications filed 1998–2003 across the U.S., the European Patent Office (and Japanese Patent Office) and firm-level R&D, the authors compare U.S. patents to “twin” foreign equivalents and exploit variation in pre-AIPA grant delays, opt-out rates, and firm technology exposure to estimate impacts on citations, citation speed, similarity, abandonments, claims, and R&D.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Accelerated patent publication

It evaluates effects on high-school students (chiefly 11th graders and graduating cohorts) and market-level school outcomes across ZOC versus non-ZOC neighborhoods in Los Angeles. ZOC combined catchment areas, expanded within-district choice with centralized rank-ordered (immediate-acceptance) assignment and lotteries for oversubscription, thereby changing competitive incentives among attendance-zone schools.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

It uses administrative employer–employee social security data (1983–2017), real-estate, public-procurement, politician, and municipal finance records to measure impacts on firms, employment, wages, and real-estate. Institutional context: the central government investigates alleged Mafia ties and appoints commissioners to run dismissed municipalities for about two years before new elections, creating plausibly exogenous variation for causal analysis.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: City council dismissal (CCD)
Outcome: Previously not-employed share of employment

# Context
Using monthly U.S. data from the postwar period (1952:1–1987:2), this paper analyzes aggregate asset returns—value‑weighted NYSE/AMEX stock index returns and 10‑year Treasury zero‑coupon bond yields—at the market level. The institutional setting is the U.S. macrofinancial environment (inflation, short‑ and long‑term nominal interest rates, and changes in Fed operating procedures, notably post‑1979). The authors use CPI deflation and McCulloch zero‑coupon yields to decompose unexpected returns into news about future dividends, inflation, real rates, and excess returns, with subsample analyses (e.g., pre/post‑1973 and pre/post‑1979).

# Context
This paper studies capital‑market liberalizations in 20 emerging markets (monthly financial series and some annual indicators through the 1980s–mid‑1990s). Using country‑level time series — equity returns, dividend yields, market‑cap/GDP, trading turnover, net U.S. holdings and credit ratings — the authors date endogenous structural breaks in VARs and examine pre/post changes. The institutional setting comprises staggered policy reforms (ADRs, country funds, foreign‑ownership caps, exchange‑rate and regulatory reforms) associated with opening domestic equity markets to international investors.

Using S&P 100 and Nasdaq 100 firms (190 firms observed as of July 17, 2001), the authors simulate taxable income and MTRs (accounting for 1998 two‑year carrybacks and 20‑year carryforwards through 2020) based on option footnote data, stock‑price simulations, and firm financials, and relate post‑option MTRs to capital structure (debt ratios) in cross‑sectional regressions controlling for firm size, profitability, R&D, tangibility and liquidity.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Employee stock option deductions
Outcome: Corporate tax payments

The approach relies on consumption‑based present‑value identities, cointegration, and VAR/time‑series forecasting to infer changing expectations in the U.S. aggregate stock market.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

For the main full-sample tests of incentive pay effects, the authors use 6,816 firm-year observations on 1,381 firms (6,743 obs on 1,374 with controls), measuring tax sheltering as the residual book–tax gap after accounting for accruals and managerial incentives primarily via the Black–Scholes value of option grants as a share of total compensation. Year dummies and firm-clustered robust standard errors are used.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Increased incentive compensation
Outcome: Tax sheltering

This paper analyzes U.S. publicly listed stocks using CRSP-Compustat data from January 1964–December 2002. Unit of observation is individual firms (monthly returns; universe averages ~3,680 stocks; also analyses of the top 500). It models a CRRA investor choosing portfolio weights as functions of firm characteristics—size, book-to-market, and 12‑month momentum—under short-sale constraints, varying horizons, and conditional on the term spread, estimating parameters by maximizing sample-average utility with bootstrap inference.

# Context
This paper examines individual U.S. investors’ mutual-fund trading using detailed brokerage transactions for ~78,000 households from January 1991–November 1996 (over 325,000 purchases across ~1,100 funds). Units are household-level fund purchases/sales and monthly fund-level inflows/outflows, with holdings split into taxable and tax-deferred accounts. Fund characteristics come from CRSP and Morningstar. The institutional setting includes U.S. realization-based capital-gains taxation, fund expense ratios and loads, allowing within-investor and within-fund comparisons to identify tax-motivated trading and cost sensitivities.

This empirical study analyzes 56,978 cross-border mergers announced worldwide between 1990 and 2007, using firm-, deal-, and country-level data on completed M&A, stock-market indices, and real exchange rates. Units include country-pair-year observations, individual transactions, and public-firm subsamples across developed and developing countries. The setting encompasses international M&A markets, variations in currencies, country stock-market performance, and institutional features (legal origin, investor protection, accounting quality), exploiting temporal variation to assess how valuation and wealth effects drive cross-border acquisition patterns.

Analyzes U.S. public-target mergers and acquisitions announced between 1984 and 2007 (primary samples of 7,498 deals, with 5,135 completed deals), merging Thomson Financial deal records with CRSP/Compustat. Unit of observation is individual M&A offers (target and bidder firms). The institutional setting is the U.S. corporate takeover market where the target’s 52‑week high is a widely reported, salient benchmark. The paper studies causal effects on offer premiums, deal success, bidder announcement returns (3-day), and quarterly aggregate merger activity.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: 52-week-high-driven component of offer premium
Outcome: Bidder announcement return

# Context
This empirical study uses contested takeover bids from Thomson One merged with CRSP/Compustat/I/B/E/S, primarily covering U.S. public bidders from 1985–2012 (and an international extension). The unit is bidding firms (winners and losers) in contests with multiple public bidders; the authors focus on long-duration (close) contests and track stock and accounting outcomes three years before and after deal completion to estimate the causal effect of winning a merger, using losing bidders as within-contest counterfactuals.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Winning the merger
Outcome: Acquiror long-run abnormal returns

The reform allowed homeowners to borrow against housing equity for non‑housing purposes (initial 60%, later 80% LTV limit) and extended mortgage maturities. Exploiting cross‑sectional variation in 1991 equity‑to‑value (driven by purchase timing), the authors analyze effects on household borrowing, entry into entrepreneurship (employers), pre‑entry incomes, and firm survival.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

Using Equifax CCP credit-bureau panels (1999–2015) and matched Social Security administrative earnings records (available through 2014), the authors estimate how flag removal (roughly 2002–2011 removals) affects credit scores, credit-card and mortgage borrowing, and formal labor-market outcomes within the FCRA credit-reporting institutional setting.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Removal of Chapter 13 bankruptcy flag
Outcome: Credit card credit limits

# Context
This paper analyzes the phased geographic rollout (2009–2011) of Visa debit cards tied to existing Bansefi savings accounts for urban beneficiaries of Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program Oportunidades/Prospera. It uses administrative transaction and balance data for ~348,000 beneficiary accounts (Jan 2007–Oct 2011) and household surveys (panel 2002–2009/10; trust and payment surveys 2010–2012) to study effects on withdrawals, account balances, consumption, and trust. Institutional context: transfers were paid into fee‑free Bansefi accounts without cards; cards enabled ATM withdrawals and easier balance checks.

The authors combine affine term-structure and VAR/state-space estimation to study bond–FX spanning and pricing-kernel components.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Purely martingale pricing-kernel shocks
Outcome: Variation of depreciation rates

Analyses exploit cross-sectional variation with firm controls, industry and time fixed effects, and asset-pricing factor adjustments in the backdrop of rising climate-policy salience (including the 2015 Paris Agreement) and heterogeneous corporate disclosure and exclusionary investor screening.

This paper studies how transplanting British common law versus French civil law affected financial development across Western concessions in China, focusing on Shanghai (1845–1936) and additional concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Units are concession- and grid-cell-level observations and firms (banks, qianzhuang, stock companies, and stock returns). Key institutional shocks are the 1869 creation of Mixed Courts (strengthening British/French legal jurisdiction) and the 1926–27 rendition returning courts to Chinese authority; authors exploit these temporal and spatial discontinuities to identify causal effects.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Rendition of Mixed Courts (switch to Chinese civil law)
Outcome: Bank density

This paper studies how randomized municipal audits by Brazil’s Office of the Comptroller General (CGU) during 2003–2014 affected firms and workers. The CGU ran televised lotteries selecting municipalities for audits of federally funded municipal procurement (covering contracts in the two prior years); auditors publicly listed firms implicated in irregularities. The unit of analysis is firm- and worker-level administrative data (matched RAIS, procurement, BNDES loans, and PIA investment) for firms—mostly outside audited municipalities—exposed by these audits across Brazilian municipalities.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

Regressions are cross-sectional (∆Yi on high-DTI share) with controls (lagged dependent variable, employment growth, income per capita, and optionally housing supply elasticity), using NMDB/HMDA data.

It combines an early-2022 randomized controlled trial that randomized display of a pay-in-30 BNPL option at checkout (~75k customers) with 2021 observational data on ~595k BNPL applications (customer credit scores, cart margins, approvals, defaults) and county-level panels (2016–2019) of checkouts to assess default cyclicality. Units include customers, shopping carts/transactions, BNPL applications, and counties; BNPL is offered in-house and subsidized by the merchant.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Offering BNPL
Outcome: merchant profitability
