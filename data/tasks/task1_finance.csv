This paper empirically examines whether excess returns on forward contracts contain permanent (unit-root) components using monthly spot and one-month forward exchange rates and short-term deposit yields for the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan over roughly 1975–1989. Units are currency exchange rates and Eurocurrency deposit forward contracts (data from Citicorp and Harris Bank). The authors estimate cointegrating relationships between spot and forward rates and decompose excess returns into permanent and transitory components to distinguish risk-premia from forecast-error or ""peso""/noise-trader explanations.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Noise traders' biased expectations
Outcome: Permanent component in excess returns

Given a context and a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
Using U.S. CRSP/Compustat data (primarily July 1963–December 1993, with many tests focused on 1973–1993), the paper analyzes individual common stocks (NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ) and value‑weighted portfolios to test whether firm characteristics (size and book‑to‑market) or factor loadings (Fama–French Mkt, HML, SMB) drive cross‑sectional returns. Portfolios are formed on June/December accounting breakpoints, the analysis exploits January seasonality and five‑year pre/post formation windows, and units of observation are firms and characteristic‑sorted/zero‑investment portfolios.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
Analyzes U.S. highly leveraged transactions (HLTs)—primarily management buyouts and leveraged recapitalizations completed in the 1980s (mostly after 1985)—following 31 firms from pre-transaction through financial distress resolution (through Dec 1995). Unit of observation is the firm; data come from SEC filings, CRSP, COMPUSTAT and Value Line industry benchmarks. The institutional setting emphasizes high leverage, junk bonds versus bank debt, and Chapter 11 restructurings, aiming to isolate costs of financial (not economic) distress by comparing firm outcomes to market and industry performance.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Time in distress
Outcome: Costs of financial distress

# Context
This paper analyzes 92 countries worldwide, using country-level measures of government ownership of the top-10 commercial and development banks (measured in the mid-1990s and pre-privatization circa 1985) and long-run outcomes over 1960–1995 and 1970–1995. The unit of observation is the country (aggregating bank-level equity shares to assets), and the institutional setting exploits cross-country variation in legal origins, privatization histories, property-rights protection, government intervention, and banking system development to study effects on subsequent financial development, productivity growth, and per-capita income growth.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

# Context
This paper evaluates Hansen–Jagannathan stochastic discount factor (SDF) variance bounds using US asset return data and simulations. It analyzes annual real stock and short-term interest returns (1891–1985), quarterly real Treasury-bill returns with per-capita consumption growth (1964Q3–1987Q4), and monthly returns on 25 value-weighted industry portfolios (1963–1994), conditioning on lagged instruments (Treasury-bill yields, dividend yield, lagged returns). Units are asset and portfolio returns; the study also estimates VARs and uses Monte Carlo/bootstrap simulations to assess finite-sample bias and derive bias-corrected bounds.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Finite-sample bias in HJ bounds
Outcome: Rate of rejecting asset-pricing models

# Context
This paper studies U.S. equity markets from 1941–2002 (with robustness checks for 1963–2002 and 1980–2002) using CRSP/Compustat and Moody’s data. The unit of observation is annually rebalanced, value-weighted stock portfolios sorted by book-to-market (quintiles and 2×3 size×B/M). It decomposes the ex-ante value (HML) premium into expected dividend-to-price and long-run dividend-growth components via Gordon-growth based predictive regressions, event-time analyses of firm payouts, VARs with macro indicators (consumption, investment, default spread), and checks including share repurchases.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

# Context
This paper studies U.S. multinational corporations using Compustat panel data from 1982–2004 and detailed BEA affiliate benchmark data (1982, 1989, 1994, 1999). The units are U.S. parent firms and their foreign affiliates. The institutional setting is the U.S. worldwide tax system—allowing deferral of U.S. tax on incorporated foreign earnings (with Subpart F and marginal/statutory rate considerations)—so repatriation tax burdens vary with host-country tax rates. The authors exploit cross-firm and within-firm (affiliate) variation to link repatriation tax costs to consolidated, domestic, and foreign cash holdings.

# Context
The paper studies 1,292 completed cash acquisitions of U.S. public target firms by U.S. bidders (private and public) during 1990–2005. Using SDC deal data with CRSP/Compustat returns and Compact Disclosure ownership, it compares announcement and completion-period target shareholder gains across bidder types (private equity, private operating, investor groups vs. public firms) and investigates whether bidder managerial ownership and target/deal characteristics explain the large premium differences in the U.S. market for corporate control.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Acquirer is private firm (vs public)
Outcome: Target shareholder gains

The unit of observation is individual CTA funds (and equally-weighted CTA indices); the institutional setting emphasizes voluntary reporting to vendor databases, resulting in backfill, survivorship and look-back biases, and a regulatory/background comparison to earlier publicly-offered commodity pools. Analyses adjust for fees (estimating gross returns) and benchmark CTA returns to public dynamic futures-based strategies.

This paper uses bilateral annual data on international bank assets and liabilities from the BIS for 18 advanced economies over 1978–2006 (153+ country-pair observations). The unit of observation is country-pair–year. It studies how de-facto banking integration and a de-jure regulatory harmonization index (timing of transposition of 27 EU FSAP Directives) affect business-cycle synchronization among developed countries, controlling for pair fixed effects and common shocks; analyses focus on tranquil pre-2007 periods and exploit within-pair changes and staggered legislative adoption.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Legislative-regulatory harmonization in financial services
Outcome: Cross-border banking integration

Key tests are restricted to issues rated by all three major CRAs (Moody’s, S&P, Fitch). Regressions include issue and issuer controls, time fixed effects, and clustered standard errors. The institutional setting is the U.S. NRSRO-based rating regime and the IG vs. HY regulatory classification rules.

Using Compustat/CRSP financials, simulated marginal tax rates, and Moody’s EDF, the authors examine how firm size, asset tangibility, R&D, profitability, and market shocks relate to default risk, account for selection into ratings (visibility instruments: NYSE listing, S&P indexes, industry-rated share), and exploit panel variation and regime-switching to assess dynamic responses to shocks.

This paper examines market learning about CEO ability using 1,873 CEO turnovers at 1,582 U.S. publicly traded firms between 1992 and 2006 (volatility data through 2009). The unit of analysis is firm-months and firm-CEO pairs, using monthly realized, idiosyncratic, and option-implied volatilities. A theoretical Bayesian learning model (dividend/earnings GBM, efficient markets) motivates tests; empirical analyses compare exogenous (death/retirement) vs forced turnovers and control for post-turnover actions, firm characteristics, and calendar effects.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Outsider / younger / less experienced CEO
Outcome: Learning speed

Using a monthly MSA‑level panel of 21 U.S. metropolitan areas from January 2000–December 2007, the paper studies how changes in the fraction of single‑family sales to out‑of‑town second‑house buyers in an MSA‑month predict subsequent MSA house price appreciation rates (and IAR appreciation). Unit of observation for this triplet is the MSA‑month; treatment is the percent/ share of purchases by out‑of‑town second‑house buyers in that month; outcome is the subsequent house price appreciation rate (and implied‑to‑actual‑rent IAR). Data sources include transactions‑level deeds, Zillow HPI, REIS rents and a user‑cost IAR benchmark.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Out-of-town second house buyer demand
Outcome: House price appreciation rate

# Context
This empirical paper analyzes U.S. mutual-fund data (monthly observations) from January 1977 through March 2011 to study how mutual-fund firms reallocate capital across managers. The unit of analysis is individual fund managers, their funds, and fund families (firms) operating in the U.S. industry. Using Vanguard index funds as passive benchmarks and detailed AUM, return and manager assignment data, the authors exploit internal promotions/demotions (changes in AUM within firms) to estimate effects on subsequent manager value added.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Internal demotion (decrease in AUM)
Outcome: Manager value added

The unit of observation is individual mortgage loans/borrowers (and lenders); the institutional setting is the pre‑crisis U.S. mortgage market, using APR≥Treasury+3% to define high‑cost loans and measuring lender ex‑post foreclosure/delinquency risk to study sorting and within‑lender pricing.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Sorting across lenders
Outcome: Incidence of high cost mortgages

The authors develop an equilibrium model of diseconomies of scale and construct a portfolio-liquidity measure to analyze tradeoffs among AUM, expense ratios, turnover, and diversification, estimating cross-sectional and panel relations while controlling for sector-quarter effects and fund fixed characteristics.

# Context
U.S. publicly listed firms (NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ) are analyzed around dividend and share-repurchase events from 1964–2013 (repurchases 1980–2013). The unit is individual firms and dividend/repurchase announcement events; the authors use firm-level monthly returns and quarterly accounting data and apply Campbell–Shiller return decompositions and VARs estimated on 60 months before/after each event. The institutional setting is corporate payout policy decisions (dividend increases/decreases, initiations, omissions, repurchase announcements), with attention to financial constraints and robustness to market-wide trends.

This paper studies the U.S. mutual fund industry using CRSP and Morningstar data on 2,285 diversified domestic equity funds (27,621 fund-year observations) spanning 1964–2015, with many structural estimations focused on 2001–2015. Units are fund-year observations and heterogeneous retail investors who sequentially search. It models fund choices of expense ratios and 12b-1/distribution marketing fees (capped at 1% by the SEC), decreasing returns to scale, and Bayesian learning about unobserved manager skill to quantify how marketing and search frictions shape flows, prices, and welfare.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Decline in investor search costs
Outcome: Management fees

Given a context and a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
This paper analyzes U.S. VC-backed first financing rounds (seed/Series A) between 2002–2010 (exit follow-up through March 2018), using about 1,695–2,581 deals for U.S.-headquartered startups (mostly Delaware/California). The unit of observation is the entrepreneur–lead VC first-round match and its contract (convertible preferred equity terms such as investor equity share, participation, pay-to-play, and board seats). The setting is the U.S. venture capital market; the authors model bargaining and endogenous selection via a dynamic search-and-matching equilibrium to assess contract effects on startup outcomes.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Participation rights
Outcome: VC fraction of firm value

Units are daily market observations around events such as scheduled/unscheduled FOMC announcements, the FOMC cycle, non‑farm payroll releases, and LSAP announcements, within the post‑1983 monetary regime (including post‑1994 disclosure and the post‑2008 ZLB era). The authors recover growth, monetary, and two distinct risk‑premium shocks from high‑frequency asset prices via sign‑restricted structural VARs.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Hedging premium increase

You are an expert economist.

# Task
Given a context and a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
This paper studies U.S. municipalities during the Great Depression (annual data 1924–1943), focusing on cities (population >1,000 in five states and all cities >100k) and municipal bonds, and on individual local public-sector workers via linked census records. It exploits variation in pre-1929 municipal leverage and in bond maturity schedules amid a setting of minimal federal/state fiscal backstops, widespread banking panics (1930–33), and collapsing municipal credit to identify how debt-driven refinancing constraints affected local public spending, infrastructure investment, crime, health, and workforce composition.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Financial leverage
Outcome: Service expenditure
