Using County Business Patterns employment, payroll, and establishment data for 170 U.S. Standard Metropolitan Areas, the paper examines growth of the top six 2‑digit industries in each city between 1956 and 1987 (≈1,016 city‑industry observations). It assesses how local specialization, competition (establishments per worker), and urban variety predict 30‑year employment and wage growth, controlling for initial employment and wages, southern location, and national industry trends, to test MAR, Porter, and Jacobs theories of knowledge spillovers.

This paper analyzes US manufacturing wage determination using CPS March microdata for roughly 400,000 workers aggregated into 19 industry-by-year cells over 1964–1985. Industry-level profit and unemployment series (profit data available 1958–1985, aggregated to 2-digit SIC) are merged with cell means of individual characteristics to test rent-sharing versus competitive and contract models. Estimations use dynamic panel specifications with year dummies and both fixed- and random-effects to trace contemporaneous and lagged profit effects on mean wages.

Given a context and a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.

# Context
This paper uses a U.S. panel of matched individual income tax returns to estimate how the 1986 Tax Reform Act's reductions in marginal income tax rates affected taxable income. It compares taxpayers' returns in 1985 and 1988 (pre/post reform), focusing on married joint filers (mostly under age 65) in a Treasury random sample of roughly 4,000–5,000 returns, and accounts for contemporaneous rule changes (capital gains inclusion, Subchapter C→S conversions, passive loss limits) to isolate behavioral responses in labor, compensation form, portfolio choices, deductions, and reporting.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: High marginal tax rates
Outcome: Deadweight losses

Units are AMI treatment episodes and patients; the institutional backdrop includes shifting payment systems (fee-for-service, Medicare prospective payment/DRGs), rising use of invasive procedures (catheterization, angioplasty, bypass), and evolving list vs. transaction prices alongside quality (survival) improvements.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Improvements in AMI treatment and survival
Outcome: Real Cost of Living Index

# Context
This paper studies the effects of the 1970 and 1977 U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments on manufacturing using plant-level Census of Manufactures data from 1967–1987. It exploits county-level, pollutant-specific attainment/nonattainment designations for four criteria pollutants across 3,070 counties and 1.75 million plant observations; polluting plants in nonattainment counties faced stricter plant-specific regulation. The unit of analysis is individual manufacturing plants; identification leverages cross-sectional and temporal variation in county nonattainment status and industry emitting status to estimate regulation impacts on employment, capital, and shipments.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: CO nonattainment designation

# Context
This paper uses U.S. aggregate annual data (primarily 1947–1997) to study how capital income taxation affects the wedge between expected pre-tax returns on the capital stock and consumption growth. Units are national aggregates—BEA measures of pre-tax and after-tax capital returns, per-capita nondurable and services consumption, and capital-income tax revenue (federal, state, local). The analysis relies on consumption Euler equations, VARs to form expectations, and TSLS estimates to infer capital supply elasticity and tax incidence in the mid-to-late 20th century United States.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: After-tax capital return

# Context
Using quarterly CRSP data from 1980–2004 Q1 on U.S. publicly traded firms (excluding utilities and financials), the paper examines how the 2003 dividend tax cut (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced top individual dividend tax rates to 15% and applied retroactively to 2003) affected corporate payout behavior — regular vs. special dividends, initiations, terminations, and payment amounts — comparing pre- and post-2003 firm-level outcomes and contrasting responses with the 1986 tax reform.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: 2003 dividend tax cut

Focuses on the U.S. national external portfolio (quarterly, 1952:Q1–2004:Q1). For this triplet the authors consider the case where U.S. gross assets are denominated in foreign currencies while gross liabilities are in domestic (dollar) currency; they show theoretically that, holding local-currency asset returns constant, a domestic-currency depreciation raises the dollar return on gross foreign assets, an effect amplified by portfolio leverage (|µa|>1) and net of domestic inflation.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Currency depreciation
Outcome: Return on gross foreign assets

Using U.S. postwar annual data from 1946–2012, the paper studies tax-unit–level reported market incomes across the income distribution (top 1%, top 5%, bottom 90%, etc.) and aggregate macro outcomes. It constructs average marginal tax rate series (income and payroll taxes) and narrative scores of exogenous federal tax reforms (Romer–Romer style) to isolate surprise marginal-rate innovations, and estimates dynamic effects of these shocks on reported incomes, GDP, unemployment, and income sources.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Average tax rate decline without marginal change
Outcome: Reported incomes

The institutional setting is England’s national assessments, small primary classes, and non‑selective secondary admissions (≈87% new peers), exploited to estimate long‑run effects of primary‑school ordinal rank conditional on test scores.

It uses a newly assembled panel of 11,575 U.S. war-contractor applicant firms (1935–1955 financials), primarily large manufacturers (covering ~40% of 1939 manufacturing employment), exploiting voluntary application windows, decentralized subdistrict implementation, and variation in instructor assignment. Eligibility required an active war contract; outcomes are firm-level sales, TFP, profitability, managerial practices, and supply-chain links.

The paper studies the effect of the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA) of 1999—which required U.S. patent applications filed on or after Nov 29, 2000 to be published 18 months after filing—on innovation and knowledge diffusion. Using patent applications filed 1998–2003 across the U.S., the European Patent Office (and Japanese Patent Office) and firm-level R&D, the authors compare U.S. patents to “twin” foreign equivalents and exploit variation in pre-AIPA grant delays, opt-out rates, and firm technology exposure to estimate impacts on citations, citation speed, similarity, abandonments, claims, and R&D.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: Accelerated patent publication

It evaluates effects on high-school students (chiefly 11th graders and graduating cohorts) and market-level school outcomes across ZOC versus non-ZOC neighborhoods in Los Angeles. ZOC combined catchment areas, expanded within-district choice with centralized rank-ordered (immediate-acceptance) assignment and lotteries for oversubscription, thereby changing competitive incentives among attendance-zone schools.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair

It uses administrative employer–employee social security data (1983–2017), real-estate, public-procurement, politician, and municipal finance records to measure impacts on firms, employment, wages, and real-estate. Institutional context: the central government investigates alleged Mafia ties and appoints commissioners to run dismissed municipalities for about two years before new elections, creating plausibly exogenous variation for causal analysis.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: City council dismissal (CCD)
Outcome: Previously not-employed share of employment
