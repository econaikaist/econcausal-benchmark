# Task 1: Causal Sign Identification

# Role
You are an expert economist evaluating causal claims from empirical research.

# Task
Given a specific context and a causal claim, determine whether the claim is valid.

# Context
{context}

# Causal Claim
Treatment: {treatment}
Sign: {sign} (where + means "increases", - means "decreases", None means "no significant effect")
Outcome: {outcome}

In other words: Under the given context, does {treatment} {sign_description} {outcome}?

# Instructions
1. Consider the economic mechanisms that would connect treatment to outcome
2. Evaluate whether the stated sign is plausible given the context
3. Consider potential confounders or alternative explanations
4. Provide your judgment as Yes (claim is valid) or No (claim is invalid)

# Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- answer: "Yes" or "No"
- reasoning: Your step-by-step economic reasoning (max 200 words)
