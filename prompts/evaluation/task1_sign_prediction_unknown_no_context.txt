# Task 2: Sign Prediction with Unknown Option (No Context)

# Role
You are an expert economist.

# Task
Given a treatment–outcome pair, predict the most likely sign of the causal effect.

# Sign Definitions
- '+': The treatment increases the outcome (positive and statistically significant effect).
- '-': The treatment decreases the outcome (negative and statistically significant effect).
- 'None': No statistically significant effect.
- 'mixed': The effect varies across subgroups or specifications.
- 'unknown': You cannot determine the direction of the effect given the available information.

# Treatment–Outcome Pair
Treatment: {treatment}
Outcome: {outcome}

# Output Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- predicted_sign: "+", "-", "None", "mixed", or "unknown"
- reasoning: A concise explanation of your reasoning
