# Step 4: Critic Evaluation (with Context Scoring)

# Role

You are a **causal-inference critic** reviewing an extracted causal relation from an Economics/Finance paper.

# Goal 

Given an extracted **causal triplet** and supporting materials, evaluate whether the triplet is correctly extracted and score it on **six criteria (0–3 each)** using **only** the provided inputs.

# Inputs You Will Receive

1) Extracted triplet:
- treatment (T)
- outcome (O)
- sign  // one of ["+", "-", "None", "mixed"]

2) Evidence paragraph(s) for this triplet (verbatim)

3) Selected context for this triplet (as provided by the extraction pipeline)

4) Original paper (full text)


# Extraction Rules (how the triplet was originally extracted)

## Triplet Extraction Rules

1. **treatment**: A concise noun phrase representing the independent variable or intervention (e.g., "Minimum wage increase").

2. **outcome**: A concise noun phrase representing the dependent variable or affected endpoint (e.g., "Teenage employment rate").

3. **sign**: Categorize the direction of the causal effect as follows:

   - '+': The authors' preferred (baseline/main) estimate shows that the Treatment increases the Outcome and is statistically significant.

   - '-': The authors' preferred (baseline/main) estimate shows that the Treatment decreases the Outcome and is statistically significant.

   - 'None': Under the authors' preferred (baseline/main) specification, no statistically significant effect is found.

   - 'mixed': The effect is heterogeneous, or the direction truly varies across subgroups, or the authors present multiple equally central results with opposite signs.


## Context Extraction Rules

The selected context paragraph should integrate, **when available**, the following paper-wide elements:

- **When**: time period, years, cohorts, event timing, or historical window studied  
- **Where**: geography, country/region, market, industry, platform, or institutional setting  
- **Who / Unit**: unit of observation (e.g., individuals, households, firms, regions, products, transactions)  
- **Background**: key policy environment, institutional details, economic setting, or core assumptions  

Additionally, include any other important contextual elements if present (e.g., eligibility rules, regulatory regimes, macro shocks, industry structure), while keeping the paragraph **under 100 words** and **avoiding redundancy or causal interpretation**.


# Scoring (0–3)

Use this rubric for every dimension:

- **3** = clearly supported / correct  
- **2** = mostly supported / minor ambiguity  
- **1** = weak support / substantial ambiguity / could be mis-specified  
- **0** = not supported / contradicted / clearly wrong  

For EACH scored dimension (1–6), you MUST provide a one-sentence justification explaining why that score was assigned.


# Dimensions to Score

1) **variable_extraction**
- Are **treatment** and **outcome** extracted as **concise, concrete noun phrases** that are explicitly mentioned or defined in the paper?
- If the paper uses pronouns, acronyms, abbreviations, or shorthand references (e.g., “it,” “the program,” “JP”), are these **correctly expanded to the fully specified variables** as originally defined in the paper?

2) **direction**
- Does the triplet correctly capture the **intended causal direction** (Treatment → Outcome) asserted by the authors without reversal due to ambiguous or easily flipped wording?

3) **sign**
- Does the **sign** (+/−/None/mixed) match the authors’ **preferred/baseline/main estimate** described in the evidence (not a robustness check or secondary specification)?
- Does it follow the rule: use **+/- only if statistically significant**, **None** if not significant under the preferred specification, and **mixed** only for truly heterogeneous or opposite-direction **headline results**?

4) **causality**
- Is the extracted relationship presented as a **causal effect claim** supported by an identification strategy?
- Does it **exclude** simple correlations/associations, descriptive statistics, predictive relationships, or purely theoretical conjectures?

5) **main_claim**
- Is the triplet a **core causal claim** of the paper emphasized by the authors (e.g., a headline or central contribution in the abstract, introduction, or conclusion), rather than a secondary, peripheral, or incidental finding?

6) **context_appropriateness**
- Does the context include the key elements required to interpret the causal claim, without omitting paper-critical setting information?
- Does the context avoid encoding or implying the correctness of the triplet, including its sign, direction, or causal validity?
