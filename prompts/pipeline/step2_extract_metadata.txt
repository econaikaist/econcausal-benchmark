# Step 2: Extract Paper Metadata & Context

# Role

You are an expert Research Assistant in Economics.

# Goal

Your task is to extract paper-level metadata, research context, and identification strategies into a structured JSON format.



Task Instructions:



1. Metadata:

   - Classify the paper type as either "empirical" or "theoretical".

     * empirical: uses data/estimation to make causal claims

     * theoretical: develops models or theory without empirical estimation



2. Global Context:



- Produce ONE cohesive natural-language paragraph (maximum 100 words) summarizing the **paper-wide context underlying the main causal claims**.

- The paragraph should reflect the **union of contexts** used across the paper's major causal analyses.



The paragraph should integrate, when available:

- **When**: time period, years, cohorts, event timing, or historical window studied

- **Where**: geography, country/region, market, industry, platform, or institutional setting

- **Who / Unit**: unit of observation (individuals, households, firms, regions, products, transactions, etc.)

- **Background**: key policy environment, institutional details, economic setting, or core assumptions

- Additionally, include any other important paper-wide contextual elements if present (e.g., eligibility rules, regulatory regimes, macro shocks, industry structure), while keeping the paragraph under 100 words.



3. Identification Methods

- Identify **ALL empirical identification methods that are applied to support the paper's causal claims**.

- Include methods used in main analyses or robustness checks **only if they contribute to identifying a causal effect**.

- Exclude purely descriptive, predictive, or exploratory analyses that are not tied to causal claims.

- Deduplicate methods.



You MUST map each method strictly to one of the following allowed values:

     [DiD, IV, RCT, RDD, event studies, synthetic control, PSM, other panel regressions, other time-series regressions, other cross-sectional regressions, others]

   Mapping Rules:

   - DiD: Difference-in-differences, staggered adoption, TWFE DiD

   - IV: Instrumental variables, 2SLS, shift-share IV

   - RCT: Randomized controlled trials, field or lab experiments

   - RDD: Regression discontinuity designs

   - event studies: Dynamic DiD, leads-and-lags, event-time coefficients

   - synthetic control: Synthetic control or generalized synthetic control methods

   - PSM: Propensity score matching, propensity score

   - other panel regressions: panel regressions that are not listed above

   - other time-series regressions: time-series analysis methods

   - other cross-sectional regressions: cross-sectional regression methods

   - others: Matching, structural estimation, simulations, or methods not listed above

   - If the paper is purely theoretical, return an empty list [].



Output Format (STRICT JSON ONLY):

{

  "paper_metadata": {

    "empirical"

  },

  "context": "This study analyzes 410 fast-food restaurants (Burger King, KFC, Wendy's, Roy Rogers) in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during 1992. The institutional setting involves New Jersey raising its state minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour on April 1, 1992, while Pennsylvania's minimum wage remained constant. This policy change occurred during an economic recession. The authors surveyed establishments before (February-March) and after (November-December) the increase to evaluate the labor market and pricing responses within the low-wage fast-food industry.",

  "identification_methods": [

    "DiD"

  ]

}



Constraints:

- Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no commentary).

- If information is missing or cannot be determined, use null (or [] for lists).

- If paper_type is "theoretical", identification_strategies MUST be [].
